## Phase 1 Deliverables

| File | Status | Word Count | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| `framework/ESF-Directive-Memo.md` | COMPLETE | ~800 | AI-drafted from BMAD sources, accepted by Nathan |
| `framework/ESF-Framework-Document.md` | DRAFT | ~10,500 | 10 sections. Gate Verification Record + Section 5.3 added post-draft. Glossary (25 entries) added at Nathan's request. |

### Phase 1 Verification Checklist

- [x] Framework document draft complete and readable
- [x] All 18 citations appear in references
- [x] 7 core constructs clearly defined with scholarly grounding
- [x] Framework Evolution Protocol included as core construct (not appendix)
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] **HUMAN GATE: Nathan reviewed and proceeded to Phase 2**
- [ ] Citation details verified (some 2024-2025 sources may need exact title/page confirmation)

### Phase 1 Gate Verification Record

- **What was reviewed:** Nathan had the framework document open in the IDE during and after drafting. He reviewed construct definitions and overall document structure.
- **What was changed:** Added Glossary of Terms (25 entries) at Nathan's request. Added Gate Verification Record mechanism to Section 4.4 and new Section 5.3.
- **What was challenged:** Nathan identified that the Human Validation Gates needed a verification mechanism: evidence of genuine engagement, not just a "yes" at the gate. This led to the Gate Verification Record addition.
- **What was decided:** Proceed to Phase 2. Framework document argues Nathan's position. Gate Verification Record strengthens the framework's accountability mechanism.
