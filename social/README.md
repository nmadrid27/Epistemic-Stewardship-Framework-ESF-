# ESF Social Media Content

LinkedIn posts, threads, and short-form writing about the Epistemic Stewardship Framework.

## Purpose

Build visibility for the framework before and during the submission/publication process. Establish Nathan's voice on epistemic stewardship, AI-assisted academic work, and faculty responsibility in AI integration.

## Post Index

| File | Platform | Topic | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| `01-what-is-esf.md` | LinkedIn | Framework introduction | DRAFT |

## Conventions

- **File naming:** `##-topic-slug.md` (numbered for sequence planning)
- **Frontmatter:** title, platform, topic, status (draft/ready/posted), posted-date
- **Length targets:** LinkedIn long-form = 700–1,200 words; LinkedIn short = 150–300 words; thread = 5–10 posts of 280 characters
- **Voice:** Direct, substantive, practitioner-facing. Not academic. No jargon without immediate plain-language translation.
- **Framework language in public posts:** Lead with the problem (losing yourself in the output), not the solution name. Let readers arrive at the framework, don't announce it.

## Content Themes

1. The core problem: AI generates fluent content that doesn't belong to you unless you actively work to make it yours
2. The Two-Level Architecture: faculty managing production ≠ students developing epistemic habits
3. The Five Questions: a portable accountability checkpoint
4. Position Statement / Directive Memo: what it means to direct AI rather than follow it
5. Records of Resistance: why keeping what you rejected matters as much as what you kept
6. Framework in practice: AI 201, AI 180, and what actually changed in the classroom
7. The bootstrapping tension: can you use a framework to build the framework? (Yes, with documentation)
8. Epistemic weight: not all AI-assisted content is the same risk: here's how to calibrate
