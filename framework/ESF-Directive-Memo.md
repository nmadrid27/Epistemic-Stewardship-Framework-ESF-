# Directive Memo: ESF Framework Document

## Thesis

The Epistemic Stewardship Framework (ESF) argues that the fundamental challenge of AI in higher education is not academic integrity (cheating), not technical literacy (tool proficiency), but **epistemic agency**: the capacity to remain the originator and owner of one's intellectual work while using AI as a cognitive partner. Current approaches fail because they frame the problem as compliance (ban-or-permit), target only students, or treat transparency as an afterthought. ESF provides a comprehensive, phase-structured methodology that treats epistemic integrity as an active practice embedded in every stage of AI-assisted knowledge work, for faculty, students, and institutions alike.

The framework is not a policy document. It is a **methodology for maintaining intellectual ownership** during AI-assisted work, grounded in established scholarship and tested through operational use.

## Emphasis

- **The Directive Memo as the core innovation.** No existing framework in the literature requires a human-only pre-drafting phase where the author asserts intellectual authority before AI touches the work. This is what separates "I approved this" from "I designed this." The memo must be positioned as the framework's most distinctive and defensible contribution.

- **Epistemic agency over technical proficiency.** The framework is about the relationship between the human and their intellectual work, not about mastering AI tools. Scholarly grounding (Wu et al., Clark & Chalmers, Hutchins) should support this emphasis: AI assistance as distributed cognition, with the human as the active endorser.

- **Faculty-facing application.** Zawacki-Richter et al. (2019) documented that nearly all AI-in-education research targets students. ESF addresses a documented gap: faculty who use AI in their own professional work need methodology, not just policy.

- **Self-revision as structural commitment.** The Framework Evolution Protocol is not an appendix item; it is a core construct. Frameworks that do not build in mechanisms for self-revision become stale policy documents. ESF must include versioning, research intake cycles, challenge protocols, and sunset criteria at the construct level.

- **Practical adoptability.** Every construct must be operationalized, not just defined. A faculty member at any institution should be able to read the framework document and understand what they would actually *do* differently.

## De-emphasis

- **Tool-specific guidance.** ESF is tool-agnostic. Do not anchor to Claude, ChatGPT, or any specific AI system. The constructs apply regardless of which tool is used.

- **Student policing.** ESF does not frame students as potential cheaters who need surveillance. The student engagement model develops epistemic agency, not compliance.

- **Comprehensive literature review.** The framework document grounds claims in scholarship but does not attempt exhaustive literature coverage. That is deferred to Phase 2 (standalone Literature Review). Keep citations purposeful and integrated, not performative.

- **Institutional policy detail.** The framework document describes the constructs. Implementation specifics (rollout models, accreditation crosswalks, assessment rubrics) are deferred to the Institutional Guide (Phase 5). Avoid policy language in the core document.

- **Institution-specific context.** While ESF emerges from practice at one institution, the framework document must be discipline-agnostic and institution-agnostic. The originating institutional experience can appear as one illustrative example among others, not as the default context.

## Pedagogical Rationale

This framework exists because I practiced something before I theorized it. The BMAD-adapted curriculum development workflow, with its Directive Memo, phased gates, Five Questions, and Integrity Reports, emerged from the actual work of building AI-integrated courses at an art and design university. It was built to solve a real problem: how do you use AI extensively in curriculum development while ensuring the course remains *yours*?

The scholarly grounding (18 verified sources, 7 concept clusters) was assembled afterward, not to justify the practice but to position it within existing knowledge. The practice preceded the theory. The framework document should reflect that intellectual honesty: this is a methodology that works, now supported by established research, not a literature-derived model seeking application.

## Voice and Stance

- **Direct and substantive.** This is a scholarly framework document, not a marketing piece. Make claims, support them, acknowledge limitations.
- **Confident but honest.** ESF fills real gaps in the literature; state that clearly. But also be honest about what it does not do (it is not a complete AI literacy curriculum, it is not an institutional policy template, it is not a technology guide).
- **Practitioner-informed scholarship.** The register is academic but accessible. A faculty member or administrator should be able to engage without specialized AI or education research vocabulary.
- **Anti-performative.** Disclosure and transparency should be presented as structural commitments embedded in workflow, not as virtue signaling. The framework should model this in its own prose: no hedging, no inflated claims.

## Non-negotiables

1. **The Five Questions must appear exactly as formulated.** They are the behavioral mechanism of epistemic stewardship. They are not suggestions; they are checkpoints.
   - Can I defend this?
   - Is this mine?
   - Did I verify?
   - Would I teach this?
   - Is the disclosure honest?

2. **The Directive Memo is human-only.** No AI drafts it, suggests its content, or provides a fill-in template. The framework document must be unambiguous about this.

3. **All 32 citations must be verified sources.** Zero tolerance for hallucinated or fabricated references. Every citation must point to a real, accessible work. (Count reflects 18 sources from Phase 1, plus 13 added in Phase 2 literature expansion, plus 1 added in verification pass: Fischer, Bearman, Boud & Tai (2024) replacing a fabricated Bearman 2024 AEIH citation.)

4. **The Framework Evolution Protocol is a core construct, not an afterthought.** It has the same structural weight as the Directive Memo or Five Questions.

5. **Novel contributions must be positioned against literature, not merely asserted.** Each of the 6 novel contributions requires evidence of the gap, not just a claim that ESF fills it. (6th contribution; Two-Level Architecture: identified and added post-Phase 5, documented in ESF-Novel-Contributions.md Section 7.6.)

6. **The framework document itself must follow ESF protocol:** this Directive Memo, an Integrity Report after drafting, and a disclosure statement on the final document.

> **Note:** This Directive Memo was AI-drafted from existing source files (curriculum-dev.md, disclosure-protocol.md, curriculum-dev SKILL.md, and the 2026-02-16 collaboration log) to bootstrap the ESF's self-validation protocol. Nathan reviewed the draft on 2026-02-18, accepted it without revision, and confirmed it accurately captured his intellectual position. The Framework Document was drafted on that basis. The bootstrapping case; AI assembly of the memo from prior human-authored operational files: is documented in ESF-Self-Application-Evidence.md (The Self-Application Protocol, item 1) and in the Integrity Report (Flagged Item 1).
