# ESF Research Summary

## How Research Was Sourced, Verified, and Integrated into the Framework

This is a living document. It tracks every scholarly source used in ESF: how each was found, what it contributes, where it appears in the framework, and what verification work remains. Update this document as new sources are added or existing ones are refined.

---

## Research Approach

### Practice First, Literature Second

ESF's constructs were built from Nathan Madrid's operational practice before any literature review was conducted. The research serves three purposes:

1. **Validation:** Confirming that the problems ESF addresses are real and documented in the field
2. **Grounding:** Connecting ESF's practitioner-built constructs to established scholarly concepts and vocabulary
3. **Positioning:** Identifying where ESF fills gaps that existing frameworks leave open

The research does *not* originate the framework's constructs. It validates and contextualizes them.

### How Sources Were Found

| Method | Sources Found | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Planning phase research** | 18 (Sources 1-7, 9, 12, 14, 16-18, 20, 22, 25, 27, 29-31) | Identified during framework planning. Verified against AI knowledge; exact bibliographic details flagged for pre-publication confirmation where needed. |
| **NotebookLM queries** | 10 (Sources 8, 10-11, 13, 15, 19, 21, 23-24, 28) | Discovered through querying Google NotebookLM research notebooks during the two-level architecture integration. Source-grounded answers from uploaded documents. |
| **Direct knowledge** | 3 (Sources 4, 6, 9) | Foundational sources Nathan knew directly (Bloom, Brown, EU AI Act). |

### Verification Standards

Every source carries an epistemic marker:

| Marker | Meaning | Count |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Confirmed** | Nathan knows this source directly or has independently verified its existence and claims | 9 |
| **Plan-verified** | Verified during planning phase; exact bibliographic details should be confirmed before publication | 9 |
| **NotebookLM-sourced** | Discovered through AI-mediated research; existence and claims verified through NotebookLM's source-grounded responses | 10 |
| **[PREPRINT]** | Not yet peer-reviewed; marked explicitly wherever cited | 3 |

**Zero tolerance for hallucinated citations.** Any source that cannot be verified is removed, not retained with a caveat.

---

## Sources by Concept Cluster

### Cluster 1: Epistemic Agency (4 sources)

The theoretical center of ESF. Establishes that intellectual ownership requires active, structural support. It does not happen automatically.

| # | Source | Year | Key Contribution to ESF | Where It Appears | Verified |
|---|--------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | Clark, A. & Chalmers, D.J. — "The extended mind" (*Analysis*) | 1998 | **Active endorsement condition.** For AI to function as a legitimate cognitive extension, the human must actively endorse its contributions. This is the philosophical anchor of the Directive Memo. | Framework Document (B.1), Novel Contributions (#1), TLDR, Self-Application Evidence | Confirmed |
| 2 | Hutchins, E. — *Cognition in the Wild* (MIT Press) | 1995 | **Distributed cognition requires coordination.** When work is distributed between human and AI, the coordination function (determining what the work argues, values, emphasizes) must remain with the human. | Framework Document (B.1) | Confirmed |
| 3 | Wu, J., Puntambekar, S. & Xiao, Y. — "Epistemic agency and AI in education" (*Educational Researcher*) | 2025 | **AI can accelerate knowledge production while undermining epistemic development.** Establishes the fundamental tension ESF is designed to address. Argues for structural mechanisms preserving human epistemic agency. | Framework Document (B.1, B.5), Literature Review (B.1, B.5) | Plan-verified |
| 4 | Bozkurt, A. — "GenAI et al.: Cocreation, authorship, ownership" (*Open Praxis*) | 2024 | **Cocreation requires new authorship frameworks.** Supports ESF's position that traditional notions of single authorship must be replaced with structured transparency about the division of intellectual labor. | Framework Document (B.1), Literature Review (B.1) | Plan-verified |

**Integration pattern:** These sources provide ESF's philosophical foundation. Clark & Chalmers appear wherever the Directive Memo is justified. Wu et al. appear wherever the epistemic agency tension is described. They validate *why* ESF exists; the constructs address *how*.

---

### Cluster 2: Human Oversight and Metacognition (4 sources)

Establishes that human oversight of AI is harder than it looks, degrades over time, and requires structural intervention.

| # | Source | Year | Key Contribution to ESF | Where It Appears | Verified |
|---|--------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 5 | Tankelevitch, L. et al. — "Metacognitive demands of GenAI" (CHI '24) | 2024 | **Metacognitive effort is not self-sustaining.** Humans underestimate the difficulty of detecting when AI output departs from their understanding. Directly motivates the Five Questions' recurring structure. | Framework Document (B.2), Literature Review (B.2), Novel Contributions (#1, #5), TLDR, Self-Application Evidence | Plan-verified |
| 6 | Atchley, R.A. et al. — "Cognitive automation in AI-assisted work" (*Cognitive Research*) | 2024 | **Repeated AI use reduces vigilance.** Cognitive automation is not a moral failing but a documented adaptation. Motivates the Gate Verification Record (external check on internal metacognitive processes). | Framework Document (B.2), Literature Review (B.2), Novel Contributions (#5), TLDR, Self-Application Evidence | Plan-verified |
| 7 | Bearman, M. et al. — "Discourses of AI in higher education assessment" (*Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Ed*) | 2024 | **Assessment must make cognitive processes visible.** Submitted work may not reflect the submitter's engagement. Supports ESF's emphasis on process documentation (Directive Memo, gate records, Integrity Reports). | Framework Document (B.2), Literature Review (B.2, B.3), Novel Contributions (#5) | Plan-verified |
| 8 | EU AI Act, Article 14 | 2024 | **Human oversight must be structural, not aspirational.** Regulatory precedent that oversight must be designed into systems. ESF extends this logic: oversight must be designed into workflows. | Framework Document (B.2), Literature Review (B.2) | Confirmed |

**Integration pattern:** These sources justify ESF's structural interventions. Tankelevitch motivates the Five Questions. Atchley motivates the Gate Verification Record. Bearman motivates process documentation. They answer the question: "Why can't people just review their own work?"

---

### Cluster 3: Content Stakes and Calibration (2 sources)

Supports the Content Epistemic Weight model: not all content demands the same level of human authority.

| # | Source | Year | Key Contribution to ESF | Where It Appears | Verified |
|---|--------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 9 | Perkins, M. et al. — AI Assessment Scale (AIAS) (*JUTLP*) | 2024 | **Graduated AI involvement scale.** Five levels for student assessment. ESF's key differentiation: AIAS frames levels as policy choices; ESF frames weight as inherent property of content type. AIAS is complementary, not competing. | Framework Document (B.3), Literature Review (B.3), Novel Contributions (#2), Comparison Matrix (full dimension) | Plan-verified |
| 10 | Bloom, B.S. et al. — *Taxonomy of Educational Objectives* | 1956 | **Cognitive taxonomy maps to human involvement demands.** Higher-order tasks (evaluate, synthesize, create) inherently require more human judgment. Provides the cognitive architecture underlying ESF's three-tier weight model. | Framework Document (B.3), Literature Review (B.3) | Confirmed |

**Integration pattern:** Perkins appears wherever ESF differentiates itself from AIAS. Bloom provides the cognitive logic for the weight tiers. Together they validate the graduated approach while showing ESF's reframing from policy choice to epistemic property.

---

### Cluster 4: Transparency and Disclosure (3 sources)

Grounds the Disclosure Protocol and its distinction between compliance transparency and epistemic transparency.

| # | Source | Year | Key Contribution to ESF | Where It Appears | Verified |
|---|--------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 11 | Weaver, K. — AI Disclosure (AID) Framework | 2024 | **Structured disclosure as professional practice.** Normalizes AI use documentation. ESF extends AID by anchoring disclosure to the Directive Memo and adding the Integrity Report as internal accountability artifact. AID templates can serve as ESF's disclosure component. | Framework Document (B.4), Literature Review (B.4), Novel Contributions (#1), Comparison Matrix (full dimension) | Plan-verified |
| 12 | Miao, F. & Holmes, W. / UNESCO — *Guidance for GenAI in Education* | 2023 | **Policy-level transparency mandate.** Establishes institutional expectations for documenting AI use. ESF translates aspirational policy to operational workflow. | Framework Document (A, B.4), Literature Review (A, B.4), Comparison Matrix (full dimension) | Confirmed |
| 13 | OECD — *AI Principles* | 2023 | **International transparency standards.** Complements UNESCO with cross-national framing. ESF positions as operational methodology within this policy context. | Framework Document (A, B.4), Literature Review (A, B.4), Comparison Matrix | Confirmed |

**Integration pattern:** Weaver is ESF's closest disclosure precedent and strongest complementarity partner. UNESCO and OECD provide the policy context ESF operates within. The key ESF contribution here is the distinction between "AI was used" (compliance) and "here is whose thinking this is" (epistemic transparency).

### Cluster 5: Cognitive Load and Partnership (1 source)

Addresses the educational paradox: reducing cognitive load may reduce learning.

| # | Source | Year | Key Contribution to ESF | Where It Appears | Verified |
|---|--------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 14 | Sweller, J. — "Cognitive load during problem solving" (*Cognitive Science*) | 1988 | **Cognitive load reduction can undermine learning.** AI eliminates effort that may be pedagogically necessary. ESF's response: redistribute cognitive load rather than simply reduce it. The Directive Memo and Five Questions reintroduce targeted effort at epistemic decision points. | Framework Document (B.5), Literature Review (B.5) | Confirmed |

**Integration pattern:** Sweller provides the theoretical basis for ESF's design philosophy. The framework does not restrict AI use but structures it to preserve the cognitive engagement that produces genuine understanding. This is especially relevant to the Level 2 (student) process.

---

### Cluster 6: Iterative Methodology (4 sources)

Grounds the phased workflow model and the Framework Evolution Protocol.

| # | Source | Year | Key Contribution to ESF | Where It Appears | Verified |
|---|--------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 15 | Brown, T. — "Design thinking" (*Harvard Business Review*) | 2008 | **Iterative cycles with human judgment at convergences.** Provides the structural logic ESF adapts. ESF's addition: epistemic accountability at each convergence, not just quality assessment. | Framework Document (B.6), Literature Review (B.6), Novel Contributions (#3) | Confirmed |
| 16 | Torrance, E.P. — *Facilitating Adult Learning* (ATD Press) | 2019 | **Structured learning cycles with decision gates.** Professional development model with explicit pause-and-evaluate points. Directly reflected in ESF's Human Validation Gates. | Framework Document (B.6), Literature Review (B.6), Novel Contributions (#3) | Plan-verified |
| 17 | Luksha, P. et al. — "Learning ecosystems for societal transformation" (*HSSC*) | 2024 | **Methodologies must be designed for adaptation.** Supports the Framework Evolution Protocol: frameworks that cannot evolve become obsolete. | Framework Document (B.6), Literature Review (B.6), TLDR (tool-agnostic rationale) | Plan-verified |
| 18 | Zawacki-Richter, O. et al. — "Systematic review: Where are the educators?" (*IJETHE*) | 2019 | **The faculty-facing gap.** Most AI-in-education research targets students. Faculty as practitioners are largely absent. Remains the strongest evidence for ESF's Novel Contribution #4. Also supports the need for framework evolution, since each AI generation displaces prior tool-specific approaches. | Framework Document (A, B.6), Literature Review (A, B.6), Novel Contributions (#4), TLDR (tool-agnostic rationale) | Confirmed |

**Integration pattern:** Brown and Torrance provide the iterative workflow logic. Luksha supports the Evolution Protocol. Zawacki-Richter is the single most important source for ESF's positioning: the faculty-facing gap identified in 2019 remains substantially open in 2026.

---

### Cluster 7: Student AI Literacy (3 sources)

Reframes AI literacy from technical competency to epistemic practice.

| # | Source | Year | Key Contribution to ESF | Where It Appears | Verified |
|---|--------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 19 | Allen, L.K. & Kendeou, P. — "AI literacy for all" (*Policy Insights*) | 2024 | **AI literacy as civic competency.** ED-AI Lit framework defines what students should understand about AI. ESF defines the methodology by which that understanding is practiced. Complementary. | Framework Document (B.7), Literature Review (B.7), Comparison Matrix (full dimension) | Plan-verified |
| 20 | Kassorla, M. et al. — "AI literacy in higher education" (EDUCAUSE) | 2024 | **Institutional AI literacy integration.** Surfaces the gap: literacy frameworks define what to understand but not how to practice understanding. ESF's engagement levels fill this gap. | Framework Document (B.7), Literature Review (B.7) | Plan-verified |
| 21 | Luckin, R. et al. — *Intelligence Unleashed* (Pearson/UCL) | 2016 | **Empowerment vs. substitution.** Foundational question: is AI empowering or replacing human effort? Runs through ESF's entire architecture. | Framework Document (B.7), Literature Review (B.7) | Confirmed |

**Integration pattern:** Allen & Kendeou and Kassorla establish the literacy landscape ESF complements. Luckin's empowerment/substitution distinction is ESF's orienting question: the framework is designed to ensure AI empowers rather than substitutes.

### Cluster 8: Scaffolded Student Engagement and Socratic AI (10 sources)

Added in v2.0 to support the two-level architecture and human-first sequencing. The newest cluster, sourced primarily through NotebookLM research queries.

| # | Source | Year | Key Contribution to ESF | Where It Appears | Verified |
|---|--------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 22 | Hutson, J. — "Scaffolded integration: Three-tiered framework" (*FARJES*) | 2025 | **Human-first sequencing.** Students must demonstrate independent proficiency before AI access. Timed tasks and oral defenses verify genuine competence. Directly supports Level 2 Phases 1-2 being human-only. | Literature Review (B.8), Student Guide, Faculty Guide (Section G) | NotebookLM-sourced |
| 23 | Washington State OSPI — *Student Scaffolding Scale for AI* | 2024 | **H-AI-H (Human-AI-Human) cycle.** Every AI interaction bookended by human inquiry and reflection. ESF's Level 2 implements this: human-only Phases 1-2, AI enters Phase 3, human-only reflection Phase 5. | Literature Review (B.8), Comparison Matrix (Student Agency) | NotebookLM-sourced |
| 24 | Pasmala, T. et al. — "Research-based learning with AI" (*Higher Education Studies*) | 2026 | **90% of cognitive load for problem identification occurs before AI assists.** AI as accelerator of already-directed inquiry. Reinforces human-first principle. | Literature Review (B.8) | NotebookLM-sourced [PREPRINT] |
| 25 | Naeem, M. — "Teaching skills and intellectual virtues with GenAI" (*Episteme*) | 2025 | **Q-Tutor model: questioning as intellectual virtue.** AI should teach questioning, not just answer. Supports ESF's human gates as Socratic questions rather than compliance checkboxes. | Literature Review (B.8) | NotebookLM-sourced |
| 26 | Favero, L. et al. — "Socratic chatbot for critical thinking" (AI in Education Workshop) | 2024 | **Maike chatbot: Socratic interaction produces deeper engagement than direct instruction.** Methodological support for ESF's gate design: gates prompt articulation, not permission. | Literature Review (B.8) | NotebookLM-sourced |
| 27 | Degen, J. & Asanov, I. — "Socratic AI, epistemic agency, and education" (*arXiv*) | 2025 | **Experimental evidence.** Socratic AI tutor vs. uninstructed chatbot at University of Kassel. Socratic group showed better epistemic agency, stronger reasoning distinction, greater willingness to challenge AI. Strongest experimental support for ESF's gate design. | Literature Review (B.8), Comparison Matrix (Student Agency) | NotebookLM-sourced [PREPRINT] |
| 28 | Plate, R. & Hutson, J. — "Composition pedagogy as AI-native coding" (*WJAEL*) | 2025 | **Process artifacts as rhetorical practice.** Interaction logs and "records of resistance" (what was rejected from AI) are themselves assessable evidence of epistemic engagement. Supports ESF's process documentation approach. | Literature Review (B.8) | NotebookLM-sourced |
| 29 | Stoyanov, V. — "Delegated reasoning and epistemic accountability" (*Preprints.org*) | 2026 | **Epistemic audit and traceability.** Delegated reasoning requires structural accountability. Philosophical parallel to ESF's Integrity Reports, though Stoyanov operates at concept level while ESF provides operational templates. | Literature Review (B.8) | NotebookLM-sourced [PREPRINT] |
| 30 | Lei, C. et al. — "GenAI-enabled CDIO teaching model" (*Computer Applications in Engineering Education*) | 2025 | **Students as systems architects.** Students managing multi-step AI workflows show gains in computational thinking. Supports ESF's progressive engagement levels where advanced students design their own epistemic processes. | Literature Review (B.8) | NotebookLM-sourced |
| 31 | Gobbo, B. — "Teaching creative AI at the Royal College of Art" (*IJADE*) | 2024 | **3C Protocol (Compare, Challenge, Curate).** Practitioner approach to creative AI pedagogy. Complements ESF's student engagement model with creative-discipline-specific framing. | Literature Review (B.8) | NotebookLM-sourced |

**Integration pattern:** This cluster converges on three principles that define Level 2: (1) human-first sequencing (Hutson, Washington OSPI, Pasmala), (2) Socratic gates that develop reasoning rather than enforce compliance (Naeem, Favero, Degen & Asanov), and (3) process artifacts that make engagement visible and assessable (Plate & Hutson, Stoyanov, Lei). These three principles were already built into Nathan's practice; the cluster provides the scholarly validation.

## Cross-Cluster Integration Map

How sources connect across clusters to support ESF's core arguments:

| ESF Argument | Primary Sources | Supporting Sources |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Epistemic agency requires structural support** | Clark & Chalmers (1998), Wu et al. (2025) | Tankelevitch et al. (2024), Atchley et al. (2024), Hutson (2025) |
| **"Review your work" is insufficient** | Tankelevitch et al. (2024), Atchley et al. (2024) | Bearman et al. (2024), Degen & Asanov (2025) |
| **Content type determines human involvement** | Bloom et al. (1956), Perkins et al. (2024) | Sweller (1988) |
| **Disclosure must be anchored to pre-drafting intent** | Weaver (2024), Clark & Chalmers (1998) | UNESCO (2023), OECD (2023) |
| **Iterative workflows need epistemic gates** | Brown (2008), Torrance (2019) | Luksha et al. (2024), Tankelevitch et al. (2024) |
| **Faculty need methodology for their own work** | Zawacki-Richter et al. (2019) | Tankelevitch et al. (2024), Atchley et al. (2024) |

## Verification Status and Remaining Work

### Fully Confirmed (9 sources)
Bloom (1956), Brown (2008), Clark & Chalmers (1998), EU AI Act (2024), Hutchins (1995), Luckin et al. (2016), UNESCO (2023), OECD (2023), Sweller (1988), Zawacki-Richter et al. (2019)

### Plan-Verified — Need Pre-Publication Confirmation (9 sources)
Allen & Kendeou (2024), Atchley et al. (2024), Bearman et al. (2024), Bozkurt (2024), Kassorla et al. (2024), Luksha et al. (2024), Perkins et al. (2024), Tankelevitch et al. (2024), Torrance (2019), Weaver (2024), Wu et al. (2025)

**Action needed:** Verify exact titles, journal volumes/issues, page numbers, and DOIs against publisher databases before submission.

### NotebookLM-Sourced — Need Independent Verification (10 sources)
Degen & Asanov (2025), Favero et al. (2024), Gobbo (2024), Hutson (2025), Lei et al. (2025), Naeem (2025), Pasmala et al. (2026), Plate & Hutson (2025), Stoyanov (2026), Washington State OSPI (2024)

**Action needed:** Independently verify existence, access full text where possible, confirm claims are accurately represented in ESF documents. NotebookLM's source-grounded responses reduce hallucination risk but do not eliminate it.

### Preprints — Monitor for Publication (3 sources)
Degen & Asanov (2025), Pasmala et al. (2026), Stoyanov (2026)

**Action needed:** Monitor for peer-reviewed publication. If published, update citations. If retracted or substantially revised, reassess integration. Preprint status is marked explicitly wherever these sources are cited.

### High-Risk Verification Items

| Item | Risk | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| Accreditation Crosswalk standard numbers (SACSCOC, HLC, NASAD, ABET) | Standard numbers may be outdated or renumbered | Verify against current accreditor publications before institutional distribution |
| Gobbo (2024) citation details | Cited in MEMORY.md as 2025 practitioner book (*Sinfonia Artificiale*) but in Literature Review as 2024 IJADE article | Reconcile: determine which publication is being cited and correct all references |
| Pasmala et al. (2026) | Future-dated publication; possibly early online or preprint mislabeled | Verify publication status and correct date if needed |

---

## Research Gaps — Sources Still Needed

As ESF continues to develop, these areas would benefit from additional scholarly grounding:

| Gap | What Would Help | Priority |
|-----|----------------|----------|
| **Empirical validation of Directive Memo effectiveness** | Studies showing that pre-drafting intellectual authority documents improve output quality or ownership retention | High (for publication) |
| **Cross-cultural applicability** | Research on epistemic stewardship in non-Western educational contexts | Medium (for international adoption) |
| **Longitudinal effects of structured AI engagement** | Studies tracking student epistemic development over multiple terms with/without scaffolded AI frameworks | High (for Level 2 validation) |
| **Institutional adoption barriers** | Research on why faculty resist or adopt AI methodologies at scale | Medium (for Institutional Guide) |
| **Discipline-specific epistemic weight** | Research on whether content epistemic weight varies meaningfully across disciplines or holds universal | Low (current claim is universality; challenge would strengthen) |

---

> **AI Collaboration Disclosure:** This research summary was organized by AI from the ESF project's source tracking records, literature review, and collaboration logs. Nathan established the structure (cluster-by-integration-map format), directed which information to include, and determined the verification assessments. AI organized the source details, cross-references, and integration patterns into the tables presented here.
