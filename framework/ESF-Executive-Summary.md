# Epistemic Stewardship Framework (ESF)

## Executive Summary

### The Problem

Universities face three failure modes with AI integration:

1. **The ban-or-permit binary.** Policies regulate whether AI is allowed but do not structure how it is used responsibly.
2. **The student-only focus.** Frameworks target student behavior while faculty use AI in their own work without equivalent methodology.
3. **Compliance framing.** AI governance is treated as a policing problem rather than a knowledge-making problem.

The result: faculty and students use AI extensively, but no comprehensive methodology exists for maintaining intellectual ownership of the work AI helps produce.

### What ESF Is

ESF is a structured methodology for maintaining genuine intellectual ownership in AI-assisted academic work. It provides specific processes, checkpoints, and documentation so that work produced with AI assistance genuinely reflects the thinking and judgment of the person responsible for it.

ESF is grounded in 31 verified scholarly sources across 8 concept clusters, including epistemic agency theory (Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Wu et al., 2025), metacognition research (Tankelevitch et al., 2024), and scaffolded learning (Hutson, 2025; Degen & Asanov, 2025).

### The Two-Level Architecture

ESF operates at two levels with distinct process models because content production and learning are fundamentally different activities.

**Level 1: Content Production** (faculty, administrators, institutional leaders)

For people who use AI to produce work that represents their professional authority.

```
SCOPE → DIRECT → BUILD → VALIDATE → DISCLOSE
```

- **Scope:** Define the task and assess its epistemic weight (high, medium, or low stakes)
- **Direct:** Write a Directive Memo establishing your intellectual position before AI engagement
- **Build:** Work with AI, checking against your memo at each stage using the Five Questions
- **Validate:** Audit the final work for drift from your original direction
- **Disclose:** Apply transparent documentation of the human-AI collaboration

The key mechanism: the **Directive Memo** captures your thinking before the AI offers its version, so you can distinguish your position from the AI's framing throughout.

**Level 2: Epistemic Development** (students)

For learners developing the capacity to work with AI while building genuine understanding.

```
INQUIRE → POSITION → EXPLORE → MAKE → REFLECT
```

- **Inquire:** Define the problem. Surface what you already know and your assumptions.
- **Position:** Write a Position Statement: your stance, what matters most, non-negotiables. No AI.
- **Explore:** Engage AI as a thinking partner. Generate options, challenge assumptions.
- **Make:** Build the work product with AI assistance. Five Questions active.
- **Reflect:** Evaluate output. Document what was kept, revised, and rejected, and why.

The critical design move: **AI does not enter until Phase 3.** Phases 1 and 2 are human-only. Students must articulate their own understanding before AI output exists to react to.

**The connection between levels:** When a faculty member uses Level 1 to design an assignment, they are simultaneously designing the epistemic environment students work within at Level 2. The framework ensures that faculty who require epistemic discipline from students are practicing it themselves.

### The Seven Core Constructs

| Construct | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Directive Memo** | Human-only document capturing intellectual direction before AI engagement |
| **Five Questions** | Recurring checkpoints: Can I defend this? Is this mine? Did I verify? Would I teach this? Is the disclosure honest? |
| **Content Epistemic Weight** | Three-tier classification (High/Medium/Low) determining which workflow components are required |
| **Human Validation Gates** | Checkpoints at phase transitions requiring documented epistemic confirmation |
| **Phased Workflow Model** | Level 1 and Level 2 process models with gates at each transition |
| **Disclosure Protocol** | Structural transparency matched to document type, anchored to the Directive Memo |
| **Framework Evolution Protocol** | Built-in mechanisms for research intake, challenge, and revision so the framework does not become stale |

### How It Works in Practice: A Complete Example

**Scenario:** Dr. Rivera, a design professor, is creating a new assignment for an intermediate course where students will use AI to develop a brand identity system.

**Dr. Rivera's Level 1 Process (designing the assignment):**

She classifies this as **medium-weight** content (it is an assignment within an existing course, not a new course proposal) and writes a brief Directive Memo:

> *This assignment tests whether students can maintain a coherent design rationale while using AI generation tools. Emphasis: the rationale drives the visuals, not the other way around. Non-negotiable: students must produce their brand rationale before generating any AI visuals.*

She uses AI to help draft the assignment brief, rubric, and project timeline. At each stage, she checks against her memo: does the rubric actually assess design rationale, or did it drift toward assessing visual polish? She catches one instance where the AI's rubric language rewards "creative use of AI tools" rather than "coherent rationale reflected in visual choices." She corrects it.

Her disclosure on the syllabus: "Assignment brief developed with AI-assisted drafting. Learning objectives, assessment criteria, and pedagogical design reflect the instructor's judgment."

**Her Students' Level 2 Process (completing the assignment):**

1. **Inquire:** Students research the client context and identify what a brand identity system needs to accomplish. They document what they already know about brand design and what assumptions they are bringing.

2. **Position:** Each student writes a Position Statement: "My brand system will prioritize [principle] because [rationale]. The non-negotiable element is [specific choice]." No AI tools yet.

3. **Explore:** Students now engage AI image generation and strategy tools. They generate options, test their rationale against AI suggestions, and note where AI pushed their thinking and where it pulled them off course.

4. **Make:** Students build the brand system, using AI for generation while checking: "Does this still reflect my position, or did I drift toward whatever looked good?"

5. **Reflect:** Final submission includes the Position Statement, the brand system, and a reflection documenting three "records of resistance" (AI outputs they rejected and why).

**What this produces:** Dr. Rivera can assess not just the quality of the brand system but the quality of the student's epistemic engagement. A student who produces visually strong work but cannot explain their rationale or defend their choices has not demonstrated the learning the assignment targets.

### Six Novel Contributions

ESF fills documented gaps in the literature:

1. **Directive Memo:** No existing framework requires pre-drafting intellectual authority
2. **Epistemic Weight as inherent property:** Reframes AI involvement from policy choice to content demand
3. **Iterative methodology + epistemic accountability:** Bridges design thinking and integrity literatures
4. **Faculty-facing methodology:** Addresses the documented gap (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019) in faculty AI practice
5. **Five Questions as structured decision gates:** Operationalizes principles into mechanisms with halt conditions
6. **Two-Level Architecture:** Distinct process models for content production and epistemic development, architecturally linked

### Implementation Path

ESF is designed for graduated adoption:

- **Individual faculty:** Start with one Directive Memo before your next AI-assisted task. Apply the Five Questions after one draft. Scale from there.
- **Department pilot:** 5-10 faculty across disciplines, one term, with shared learning sessions.
- **Institutional rollout:** Policy integration, student orientation, assessment rubrics, accreditation alignment.

The framework includes templates (Directive Memo, Integrity Report, Course AI Policy, Student Reflection, Institutional Policy), accreditation crosswalks (SACSCOC, HLC, NASAD, ABET), and assessment rubrics at faculty, student, and institutional levels.

### What ESF Is Not

- Not a replacement for existing frameworks. ESF works alongside AIAS (assessment), AID (disclosure), and institutional policies.
- Not an AI restriction tool. It structures AI use to preserve intellectual ownership, not to limit it.
- Not static. The Framework Evolution Protocol builds in research intake, challenge protocols, and sunset criteria.
