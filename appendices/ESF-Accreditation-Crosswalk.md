# ESF Accreditation Crosswalk

## Mapping ESF to Accreditation Standards

---

## Purpose

This crosswalk maps ESF constructs and practices to the standards of four major accrediting bodies. The mapping demonstrates that ESF adoption supports, and provides evidence for, existing accreditation requirements. ESF does not create new compliance obligations. It provides a methodology that makes existing obligations around academic integrity, student learning outcomes, faculty qualifications, and institutional effectiveness more achievable in an AI-integrated environment.

---

## How to Use This Crosswalk

1. Identify your institution's primary accreditor(s)
2. Locate the relevant column(s) in the mapping tables below
3. For each ESF practice you adopt, note the accreditation theme it supports
4. Include this mapping in your accreditation self-study or compliance report
5. Use the "Evidence" column to identify what documentation to collect

| **HLC** | Assessment uses relevant evidence | Weight calibration ensures assessment instruments reflect faculty judgment proportional to their stakes | Assessment inventory with weight classifications |
| **NASAD** | Competencies appropriate for degree type | Weight system ensures creative portfolio assessments receive the high-level faculty oversight their stakes demand | Weight classifications for studio critiques and portfolio reviews |
| **ABET** | Continuous improvement using assessment results | Weight classification ensures continuous improvement processes prioritize high-stakes assessment data | Weight-tagged assessment data in continuous improvement reports |

### Human Validation Gates and Five Questions

| Accreditor | Relevant Accreditation Theme | How ESF Supports It | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **SACSCOC** | Full-time faculty adequate to support mission | Gates document faculty engagement with their own work product, demonstrating substantive involvement | Gate Verification Records |
| **HLC** | Integrity in all activities | Five Questions provide a structured mechanism for ensuring intellectual honesty in AI-assisted work | Integrity Reports with Five Questions documentation |
| **NASAD** | Faculty demonstrate continuing professional development | Gates applied to faculty's own creative and scholarly work demonstrate active professional practice | Gate Verification Records for faculty creative work |
| **ABET** | Faculty qualifications and authority | Gates ensure faculty maintain authority over curriculum and assessment design | Gate Verification Records for course materials |

### Disclosure Protocol and Integrity Reports

| Accreditor | Relevant Accreditation Theme | How ESF Supports It | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **SACSCOC** | Integrity and transparency in all activities | Disclosure Protocol provides structured transparency about AI's role in institutional documents | Disclosure statements on accreditation materials; Integrity Reports |
| **HLC** | Integrity in operations | Systematic disclosure demonstrates institutional commitment to transparency about AI use | Institutional disclosure policy; sample Integrity Reports |
| **NASAD** | Published policies on academic integrity | ESF's Disclosure Protocol extends academic integrity to include AI use transparency | Course AI Policies with disclosure requirements |
| **ABET** | Students, student performance, professional development | Disclosure requirements prepare students for professional practice standards around AI transparency | Student disclosures and Reflection templates |

### Student Engagement Levels

## Limitations

1. **Accreditation themes evolve.** Accreditation standards are updated periodically. The thematic categories in this crosswalk reflect standards as of early 2026. Consult your accreditation liaison to confirm current standard alignment before using this crosswalk in official reports.

2. **Interpretation varies.** Accreditation reviewers may interpret standards differently. This crosswalk provides a defensible mapping, not a guaranteed interpretation. Consult your accreditation liaison.

3. **ESF is one approach.** Accreditors do not require ESF specifically. They require evidence of structured, intentional AI integration. ESF provides a methodology for producing that evidence, but institutions may meet standards through other means.

4. **AI-specific standards are emerging.** Some accreditors are developing AI-specific standards or guidance. Monitor your accreditor's publications for updates that may affect this mapping.

> **AI Collaboration Disclosure:** This crosswalk was developed through human-AI collaboration. The accreditation themes referenced are based on publicly available standards documents from SACSCOC, HLC, NASAD, and ABET as of early 2026. AI assisted with tabular organization, consistent formatting, and cross-referencing ESF constructs to accreditation themes. All claims about how ESF supports specific accreditation themes reflect the author's professional judgment. Consult current accreditor publications to confirm thematic alignment before use in official accreditation reports.
