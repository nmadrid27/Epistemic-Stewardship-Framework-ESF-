# ESF Comparison Matrix

## AI-in-Education Frameworks: A Structured Comparison

---

## Purpose

This matrix provides a fair, structured comparison of ESF against four existing frameworks that address AI integration in higher education. The comparison shows complementarity, not competition. Each framework serves a distinct purpose, and most can be used alongside ESF.

---

## Frameworks Compared

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Primary Source | Year |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|------|
| **ESF** | Epistemic Stewardship Framework | Madrid (2026) | 2026 |
| **AIAS** | AI Assessment Scale | Perkins et al. | 2024 |
| **ED-AI Lit** | AI Literacy Framework | Allen & Kendeou | 2024 |
| **AID** | AI Disclosure Framework | Weaver | 2024 |
| **UNESCO** | Guidance for Generative AI in Education and Research | Miao & Holmes | 2023 |

---

## Dimension-by-Dimension Comparison

### Primary Audience

| Framework | Primary Audience | Secondary Audience |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **ESF** | Faculty (as practitioners, Level 1) and students (as developing epistemic agents, Level 2) | Institutional leadership |
| **AIAS** | Instructors (as assessment designers) | Students (as assessment subjects) |
| **ED-AI Lit** | Educators and policymakers | Students, general public |
| **AID** | Faculty and students (as disclosers) | Institutional leadership |
| **UNESCO** | Policymakers and institutional leaders | Educators, researchers |

**Analysis.** ESF is the only framework that provides distinct process models for both faculty and students. Faculty are positioned as *practitioners* who need methodology for their own work (Level 1), not just as implementers of student-facing tools. Students receive a structurally different process (Level 2) designed for epistemic development rather than simplified content production. Other frameworks address one audience or the other, but not both with purpose-built methodologies within a single integrated architecture. This two-level design is the basis for ESF's Novel Contribution #6.

---

### Pre-Drafting Structure

| Framework | Pre-drafting mechanism | Human authority assertion |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **ESF** | Directive Memo (human-only, structured, documented) | Thesis, emphasis, de-emphasis, rationale, voice, non-negotiables established before AI engagement |
| **AIAS** | None | AI involvement level set by instructor, but no mechanism for establishing intellectual direction |
| **ED-AI Lit** | None | Competency model; no production-process intervention |
| **AID** | None | Disclosure occurs post-production; no pre-drafting mechanism |
| **UNESCO** | None | Principles-level guidance; no workflow-level mechanism |

**Analysis.** The Directive Memo is ESF's most distinctive structural feature. No other framework intervenes in the production process before AI engagement begins. This is the basis for ESF's Novel Contribution #1.

---

### Epistemic Weight / AI Involvement Model

| Framework | Model | Basis | Applied by |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| **ESF** | Three tiers: High / Medium / Low | Inherent cognitive demands of content type (Bloom's taxonomy logic) | The user, for any content, in any context |
| **AIAS** | Five levels: No AI to Full AI | Policy choice by instructor for student assessment | Instructor, for student assignments |
| **ED-AI Lit** | Not applicable | Literacy competency model, not a calibration system | N/A |
| **AID** | Not applicable | Disclosure-focused, not involvement-focused | N/A |
| **UNESCO** | Not applicable | Policy principles, not operational calibration | N/A |

**Analysis.** ESF and AIAS both provide graduated models but differ in framing. AIAS asks "how much AI should we allow?" (policy). ESF asks "how much human authority does this content demand?" (epistemology). AIAS applies to student assessment only. ESF applies to any content produced by any user. The two can work together: AIAS for student assessment calibration, ESF for the faculty's own workflow.

---

### Validation Methodology

| Framework | Validation mechanism | Recurring? | Halt condition? | Documented? |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **ESF** | Human Validation Gates with Five Questions + Gate Verification Record | Yes, at every phase transition | Yes: "no" to any question halts workflow | Yes, Gate Verification Record |
| **AIAS** | Instructor review of AI-involvement compliance | Per assessment | No explicit halt | Not specified |
| **ED-AI Lit** | Assessment of literacy competencies | Per evaluation cycle | No | Through standard assessment |
| **AID** | Self-audit of disclosure accuracy | Per document | No explicit halt | Through disclosure statement |
| **UNESCO** | Policy compliance monitoring | Per institutional cycle | No | Through institutional reporting |

**Analysis.** ESF is the only framework with mandatory, recurring, documented epistemic checkpoints that include explicit halt conditions. Other frameworks include review or assessment mechanisms, but none structures them as gates with halt conditions and verification records. This is the basis for ESF's Novel Contribution #5.

---

### Student Agency Model

| Framework | Student framing | Developmental model | Agency orientation |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **ESF** | Developing epistemic agents (Level 2) | Distinct student process: Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect. AI enters Phase 3 only. Four engagement levels: Discovery, Guided Use, Independent Use, Critical Partnership | Progressive independence; Socratic gates verify understanding; scaffolding removed as capacity grows |
| **AIAS** | Assessment subjects | AI involvement levels assigned by instructor | Compliance with instructor-set parameters |
| **ED-AI Lit** | Learners acquiring competencies | Multi-dimensional literacy model | Competency acquisition |
| **AID** | Disclosers of AI use | Not developmental | Transparency practice |
| **UNESCO** | Rights-holders and learners | Not specified in detail | Equity and access emphasis |

**Analysis.** ESF is the only framework with a dedicated student process model distinct from its faculty workflow. Students follow Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect (not the faculty's Scope, Direct, Build, Validate, Disclose) because the purpose is different: developing epistemic agency rather than producing content. The human-first sequencing (AI does not enter until Phase 3) is supported by converging research from Hutson (2025), Washington State OSPI (2024), and Degen and Asanov (2025).

AIAS assigns AI involvement levels to students but does not structure the process by which students develop the capacity to make those calibrations themselves. ED-AI Lit specifies what students should understand; ESF specifies a structured methodology for practicing that understanding. ESF's four engagement levels scaffold students from instructor-guided gates (Discovery) to designing their own epistemic checkpoints (Critical Partnership).

### Disclosure System

| Framework | Disclosure mechanism | Anchored to pre-drafting intent? | Internal accountability artifact? |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **ESF** | Disclosure statement (external, by document type) + Integrity Report (internal) | Yes: Directive Memo provides evaluative standard | Yes: Integrity Report documents memo alignment, AI contribution by dimension, verification status |
| **AIAS** | Not a disclosure framework | N/A | N/A |
| **ED-AI Lit** | Not a disclosure framework | N/A | N/A |
| **AID** | Disclosure templates by document type | No, disclosure stands alone | No, disclosure is the accountability mechanism |
| **UNESCO** | Transparency principles | No, principle-level, not operational | No |

**Analysis.** ESF extends AID's disclosure approach in two directions. First, it anchors disclosure to the Directive Memo, so the disclosure has a documented standard it can be verified against. Second, it introduces the Integrity Report as an internal accountability artifact that goes beyond what the disclosure statement communicates publicly. AID templates can function as the disclosure component within ESF's protocol.

---

### Faculty Workflow

| Framework | Faculty workflow guidance | Phased? | Discipline-agnostic? |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------|---------------------|
| **ESF** | Five-phase workflow: Scope, Direct, Build, Validate, Disclose | Yes, 5 phases with gates at each transition | Yes, designed for any discipline |
| **AIAS** | Assessment design guidance (selecting AI involvement level) | No, single decision point | Yes |
| **ED-AI Lit** | Curriculum design for AI literacy instruction | Partially, module/course level | Yes |
| **AID** | Disclosure implementation guidance | No, single action (apply disclosure) | Yes |
| **UNESCO** | Policy implementation guidance | Partially, institutional phases | Yes (policy level) |

**Analysis.** ESF is the only framework providing a phased production workflow for faculty professional work. Other frameworks provide decision points (AIAS: select a level), single actions (AID: apply a disclosure), or institutional processes (UNESCO: implement policy). None provides a structured methodology for the actual work of producing AI-assisted content.

---

### Iterative Structure

| Framework | Iteration model | Epistemic checks within iterations? | Drift detection? |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **ESF** | Iterative five-phase workflow; recursive for complex projects | Yes, Five Questions at every gate | Yes, Directive Memo alignment check at Validate phase |
| **AIAS** | Not iterative | N/A | N/A |
| **ED-AI Lit** | Not iterative (competency model) | N/A | N/A |
| **AID** | Not iterative | N/A | N/A |
| **UNESCO** | Iterative at policy level (review cycles) | Not epistemic | Not applicable |

**Analysis.** ESF is the only framework that provides an iterative production methodology with epistemic accountability embedded at each iteration. This is the basis for ESF's Novel Contribution #3.

---

### Framework Evolution Mechanism

| Framework | Built-in evolution? | Research intake? | Challenge protocol? | Sunset criteria? |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **ESF** | Yes, Framework Evolution Protocol (core construct) | Quarterly/per-term cycle | Yes, contradictions documented, not absorbed | Yes, per construct |
| **AIAS** | No | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **ED-AI Lit** | No | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **AID** | No | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **UNESCO** | Implicit, guidance intended to be updated | Not structured | Not structured | Not structured |

**Analysis.** No framework other than ESF includes structural mechanisms for its own revision. This is not a criticism of the other frameworks. They are published as scholarly contributions, and the conventions of scholarly publication do not typically include self-revision mechanisms. The consequence is that frameworks must be replaced rather than evolved when they no longer fit the AI landscape. ESF's Evolution Protocol builds revision into the framework's architecture.

---

### Two-Level Architecture (Producer / Learner Distinction)

| Framework | Separate faculty process? | Separate student process? | Architecturally linked? | Human-first sequencing for students? |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **ESF** | Yes, Level 1: Scope, Direct, Build, Validate, Disclose | Yes, Level 2: Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect | Yes, Level 1 assignment design creates Level 2 learning conditions | Yes, AI excluded from Phases 1-2 |
| **AIAS** | No faculty process | Student assessment levels (assigned by instructor) | No, one-directional (instructor to student) | No |
| **ED-AI Lit** | No faculty process | Competency targets (not process) | No | No |
| **AID** | Disclosure guidance (not production process) | Same disclosure guidance | Parallel, not linked | No |
| **UNESCO** | Policy guidance | Policy guidance | Parallel, not linked | No |

**Analysis.** ESF is the only framework with structurally distinct process models for faculty and students, connected by architectural design. The distinction is not merely organizational (separate chapters or guides) but structural: the processes have different phases, different gate questions, and different purposes. Level 1 gates ask "Is this good enough to put into the world?" (quality assurance). Level 2 gates ask "Do I actually understand what I'm doing?" (learning verification). No other framework makes this distinction explicit or provides purpose-built methodologies for both. This is the basis for ESF's Novel Contribution #6.

---

## Complementarity Map

ESF is designed to work alongside existing frameworks, not replace them.

| Combination | How they work together |
|------------|----------------------|
| **ESF + AIAS** | Faculty use ESF Level 1 for their own work. AIAS levels map to ESF Level 2 engagement levels for student assessments: AIAS Level 1-2 aligns with Discovery/Guided Use, AIAS Level 3-4 with Independent Use, AIAS Level 5 with Critical Partnership (where the student can defend the choice). ESF's Content Epistemic Weight informs AIAS level selection. |
| **ESF + AID** | AID disclosure templates serve as the disclosure component of ESF's Disclosure Protocol at both levels. ESF extends AID with the Directive Memo anchor (Level 1) and Position Statement anchor (Level 2), plus the Integrity Report. |
| **ESF + ED-AI Lit** | ED-AI Lit competencies define what students should understand. ESF Level 2 defines how they practice that understanding through the Inquire-Position-Explore-Make-Reflect process with progressively independent gate management. |
| **ESF + UNESCO** | UNESCO principles provide the policy foundation. ESF provides the operational methodology at both levels: Level 1 for faculty and institutional practice, Level 2 for student development. |
| **ESF + AIAS + AID** | A comprehensive stack: AIAS for assessment calibration within ESF Level 2, AID for disclosure templates at both levels, ESF for the production methodology (Level 1) and epistemic development process (Level 2) that connects them. |

## Limitations of This Comparison

1. **Publication context differs.** UNESCO's guidance and the OECD's principles are policy documents, not scholarly frameworks. Comparing them dimension-by-dimension with scholarly frameworks (AIAS, AID, ESF) risks false equivalence. The comparison is structured by what each contribution provides, not by what it intended to provide.

2. **Frameworks are evolving.** AIAS, AID, and ED-AI Lit are recent contributions that may be expanded in future versions. This matrix represents their current published form as of early 2026.

3. **ESF is untested at scale.** ESF's constructs are derived from a single practitioner's operational system (the author's BMAD-adapted workflow at one institution). The other frameworks, while also early, have been developed through broader research programs. ESF's claims of novel contribution are positioned against the literature, not validated through large-scale empirical testing. This limitation is acknowledged, not concealed.

4. **Complementarity may be overstated.** The complementarity map assumes that frameworks can be layered without conflict. In practice, institutional adoption of multiple frameworks creates complexity that the map does not fully address. Implementation guidance (Phase 5: Institutional Guide) will need to address this.

> **AI Collaboration Disclosure:** This comparison matrix was developed through human-AI collaboration. The author selected the comparison dimensions, determined the analytical framing (complementarity over competition), and assessed each framework's positioning. AI assisted with tabular organization, consistent formatting, and ensuring each framework was represented fairly. Particular care was taken to represent competing frameworks accurately and to acknowledge ESF's limitations alongside its contributions.
