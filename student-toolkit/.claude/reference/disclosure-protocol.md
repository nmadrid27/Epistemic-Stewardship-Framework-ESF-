# ESF Disclosure Protocol — Student Reference

## Why Disclosure Matters

Disclosure is not a formality. It is the final act of epistemic stewardship: an honest accounting of what you contributed and what the AI contributed. Your instructor uses it to understand your process. You use it to hold yourself accountable.

A disclosure that understates AI involvement is dishonest. A disclosure that overstates it — implying AI did more than it did — is also dishonest, and undersells your own work.

**The standard:** If someone read your disclosure and then read your full AI conversation transcript, would the two match? If not, revise the disclosure.

## Disclosure Rules

1. **Always include a disclosure** at the end of every AI-assisted project submission.
2. **Be specific.** Name the tasks AI assisted with. Do not use vague language like "I used AI for help."
3. **Match the level of AI involvement.** A project where AI drafted a structural outline requires a different disclosure than one where AI generated 80% of the content.
4. **Reference your Position Statement.** Your disclosure should confirm that the conceptual direction and intellectual position reflect your own thinking.
5. **If your instructor has specific requirements**, follow those first. This protocol supports — it does not replace — course-specific policies.

## What Good Disclosure Looks Like vs. What It Doesn't

**Too vague:**
> "I used AI to help with this project."

**Dishonestly understated:**
> "I used AI only for minor grammar edits." *(when AI drafted significant sections)*

**Dishonestly overstated:**
> "AI wrote most of this and I edited it." *(when you substantially directed and revised)*

**Good — specific and honest:**
> "I used AI to generate three alternative compositional approaches during the Explore phase. I rejected two because they defaulted to high-drama framing that contradicted my Position Statement. The selected approach was substantially reworked in the Make phase. The conceptual direction, color decisions, and final execution are my own."

## Disclosure Templates

Use the template that matches your submission type. Adapt the specific details to your project.

---

### Studio / Design Project

> **AI Use Disclosure:** This project was developed using the ESF five-phase process. My Position Statement (on file) was written before any AI engagement. AI was used during [Explore / Make / both] phases for [describe specific tasks: e.g., generating compositional references, drafting structural options, exploring color variations]. [Describe what you kept, revised, or rejected and why.] The conceptual direction, [specific decisions: aesthetic choices / material decisions / structural argument], and final execution are my own work. [Add Records of Resistance note if required by your course.]

---

### Written Assignment / Essay / Report

> **AI Use Disclosure:** This [assignment type] was developed using the ESF five-phase process. My Position Statement was written before any AI engagement. AI assisted with [describe specific tasks: e.g., generating counterarguments in the Explore phase, drafting a structural outline, organizing the literature review]. [Describe what you kept, revised, and what you chose not to use.] The [analysis / argument / interpretation / conclusions] are my own. All sources cited have been independently verified.

---

### Code / Technical Project

> **AI Use Disclosure:** This project was developed using the ESF five-phase process. My Position Statement (on file) defined my approach before any AI engagement. AI assisted with [describe: e.g., generating initial code structure, suggesting implementation approaches, debugging specific components]. [Describe what you kept, revised, or implemented differently.] The [system design / algorithm choices / architectural decisions / analysis] are my own. All code has been reviewed and understood by me.

---

### Portfolio / Presentation

> **AI Use Disclosure:** The work in this portfolio was developed using the ESF five-phase process across [number] projects. For each project, a Position Statement was written before AI engagement. AI assisted with [describe general pattern of use across projects: e.g., generating compositional references, drafting text, exploring variations]. The conceptual direction, design decisions, and creative positions reflected in this portfolio are my own.

---

### Minimal AI Use

> **AI Use Disclosure:** AI tools were used minimally in this project for [describe: e.g., grammar review, generating a brief resource list for verification]. The content, analysis, design, and intellectual direction are entirely my own.

## The Five Questions as Disclosure Check

Before submitting your disclosure, apply these five questions. All five should be answerable "yes." If any is "no," revise your work or your disclosure before submitting.

1. **Can I defend this?** Could I explain every significant decision in this project without saying "the AI suggested it"?
2. **Is this mine?** Does this reflect my actual position, or did I drift toward AI framing?
3. **Did I verify?** Have I independently confirmed factual claims, sources, and data?
4. **Would I teach this?** Could I explain my process to a classmate in a way that demonstrates learning?
5. **Is my disclosure honest?** Does my disclosure accurately describe what I contributed and what the AI contributed?

---

## When Your Disclosure Reveals Heavy AI Use

If you complete the Five Questions and realize your disclosure would reveal substantial AI contribution — more than you intended — you have two honest options:

1. **Do more of the work yourself.** Go back and substantially revise the AI-generated sections so the work genuinely reflects your thinking. Update the disclosure accordingly.
2. **Disclose accurately and explain.** Submit the honest disclosure. Talk to your instructor about what happened and what you would do differently. Honest disclosure of a mistake is always better than concealment.

What you should not do is submit a disclosure that understates AI involvement to protect your grade. The purpose of ESF is to develop honest, evolving practice — not perfect compliance.

## Records of Resistance

If your course requires Records of Resistance documentation, include a brief note in your disclosure:

> *Records of Resistance: [number] documented. Key moments: [brief description of 1–2 significant decisions where you revised or rejected AI output and why.]*

The full Records of Resistance document lives at `projects/[course]/records-of-resistance/[project-name].md`.
