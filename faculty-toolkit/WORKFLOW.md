# ESF Workflow Diagrams

Two levels, one framework. Faculty use Level 1 to produce course materials with intellectual integrity. Students use Level 2 to develop epistemic agency through those materials. The project brief is the bridge.

## The Five Questions

Applied at every human gate in both levels.

| # | Question | Tests For |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Can I defend this?** | Genuine understanding vs. surface familiarity |
| 2 | **Is this mine?** | Did I direct this, or accept AI's framing? (design authority test) |
| 3 | **Did I verify?** | Independent confirmation vs. assumed accuracy |
| 4 | **Would I teach this?** | Deep endorsement vs. shallow approval |
| 5 | **Is my disclosure honest?** | Transparent accountability vs. performative compliance |

If any answer is **no**, revise, reduce AI contribution, or disclose accurately. The third option is not a failure. It is intellectual honesty.

## Student Posture: Art Director and Orchestrator

For technical and creative computing projects, the Level 2 process has two complementary postures.

**Art Director** describes the creative authority relationship: the student defines the vision, sets the aesthetic and conceptual direction, and evaluates all AI output against that vision. AI is the creative material, not the decision-maker.

**Orchestrator** describes the technical coordination relationship: the student decides what each AI capability does, how components communicate, and what the whole system means. AI is the engineering team. The student decides the architecture.

Students in AI 201 use both. Students in AI 301 formalize the orchestrator role as the core of agentic design. Naming both postures in AI 180 and AI 201 prepares students for that transition.

## Working Across Sessions

For projects that span multiple AI sessions, students should briefly re-establish their Position Statement and key decisions at the start of each session. This is not repetitive; it is how the student retains ownership of the project's memory.

What the student chooses to re-establish tells them what the highest-weight decisions are: the ones only they can hold. This is a practical application of Content Epistemic Weight at the student level.

**A process blog prompt that works well here:** "What did you need to re-establish with AI at the start of this session, and what does that tell you about who is holding the project's creative memory?"

---

## Artifact Storage Reference

The toolkit saves three types of process artifacts to named paths so they persist across sessions and serve as an audit trail.

| Artifact | When Required | Course Documents Path | General Documents Path |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Directive Memo** | Before Build phase (high and medium weight) | `courses/[course]/directive-memos/[task]-memo.md` | `documents/directive-memos/[task]-memo.md` |
| **Integrity Report** | After Validate phase (high weight) | `courses/[course]/integrity-reports/[task]-integrity-report.md` | `documents/integrity-reports/[task]-integrity-report.md` |
| **Gate Verification Record** | After Validate phase (medium weight) | `courses/[course]/gate-records/[task]-gate-record.md` | `documents/gate-records/[task]-gate-record.md` |

**Naming convention:** `[task]` is a short, descriptive slug for the work (e.g., `syllabus-revision`, `midterm-rubric`, `accreditation-narrative`).

**Low-weight content** does not generate artifacts beyond the deliverable itself and an attribution footer.

## Content Epistemic Weight at a Glance

| Weight | Requires | Faculty Examples | Student Examples |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **High** | Full workflow · Directive Memo · Integrity Report | Exams, tenure materials, accreditation reports, scholarship | Final portfolio, capstone, thesis |
| **Medium** | Standard workflow · abbreviated memo · disclosure | Syllabi, assignments, rubrics, committee reports | Major projects, research papers |
| **Low** | Scope → Build → attribution | Schedules, agendas, resource lists | Quick responses, drafts for review |
