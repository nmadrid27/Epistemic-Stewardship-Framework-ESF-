# AI Collaboration Disclosure Protocol

## Purpose

All documents produced through AI-assisted workflows must include an appropriate disclosure statement matched to document type. This protocol is the single source of truth for disclosure practices across all ESF faculty work.

The disclosure protocol serves two functions:
1. **External transparency** — Accurately communicate the nature of AI collaboration to readers
2. **Internal accountability** — Enforce epistemic integrity by requiring you to assess and declare the division of intellectual labor

---

## Disclosure Rules

1. **Always include a disclosure statement** at the end of every document unless you explicitly opt out.
2. **Match the disclosure to the document type** using the templates below.
3. **Place the disclosure** as the final section of the document, under a heading labeled `AI Collaboration Disclosure`, `AI-Assisted Development`, `AI Disclosure`, or `Methodology Note`, depending on context.
4. **Never overstate AI contribution.** You provide all intellectual direction, domain expertise, pedagogical reasoning, and final editorial judgment.
5. **Never understate AI contribution.** Acknowledge that AI tools assisted with drafting, structuring, iterating, or synthesizing.
6. **Be specific about AI contribution types.** Distinguish between structural organization, language drafting, research synthesis, and other forms of AI assistance rather than using generic language.
7. **Note verification status.** For documents containing citations or factual claims, the disclosure should confirm whether citations have been independently verified.

## Content Epistemic Weight and Disclosure Depth

### High Stakes — Full disclosure + Integrity Report

- Course syllabi, program proposals, accreditation materials
- Published or presented scholarship
- Award submissions
- Institutional reports with strategic recommendations
- Any document where a Directive Memo was used

**Required:** Disclosure template + Integrity Report (`templates/integrity-report-template.md`) + Directive Memo alignment confirmation

### Medium Stakes — Standard disclosure

- Assignment descriptions, project briefs
- Lecture outlines, reading guides
- Internal strategy documents, committee reports
- Workshop materials

**Required:** Disclosure template matching document type

### Low Stakes — Attribution footer

- Schedules, calendars, resource lists
- Meeting notes, internal working documents
- Administrative formatting

**Required:** Attribution footer (tool used, AI role, review status)

## Disclosure Templates by Document Type

### Application Materials
> **AI Collaboration Disclosure:** This document was developed through an iterative human-AI collaboration process using Claude (Anthropic) as a drafting and structuring tool. All pedagogical frameworks, strategic arguments, research interpretation, and professional claims reflect the author's expertise, judgment, and direct experience. Source citations have been independently verified.

### Course Syllabi and Learning Materials
> **AI-Assisted Development:** Course materials were developed using AI tools as part of an iterative design process. All learning outcomes, assessment criteria, pedagogical rationale, and content decisions reflect the instructor's professional judgment and align with institutional standards.

**When a Directive Memo was used**, append:
> The intellectual direction for this course — including thesis, emphasis, pedagogical rationale, and non-negotiable elements — was established by the instructor prior to AI-assisted drafting. An Integrity Report documenting AI contribution levels and Directive Memo alignment is available upon request.

### Published or Presented Scholarship
> **AI Disclosure:** The author used AI-assisted tools (Claude, Anthropic) during the drafting and revision process for structural organization and language refinement. All research claims, analytical frameworks, interpretive arguments, and citations were generated, selected, and verified by the author. The AI tool did not contribute original ideas, data analysis, or intellectual direction. The author assumes full responsibility for the content and integrity of this work.

### Institutional Reports and Briefs
> **Methodology Note:** This report was developed using an AI-assisted workflow for drafting and data synthesis. All findings, recommendations, and strategic analysis reflect the author's professional assessment. Data sources and citations have been independently verified.

### Award Submissions and Pitch Materials
> **AI Collaboration Disclosure:** This submission was developed using AI-assisted tools for drafting, structural organization, and synthesis. All strategic decisions, professional vision, and impact claims reflect the author's direct experience and professional judgment.

### General / Default
> This content was produced through human-AI collaboration. The author directed all intellectual decisions and verified all claims. AI tools assisted with drafting and structural refinement.

## The Five Questions as Disclosure Check

Before applying any disclosure, confirm you can answer all five affirmatively:

1. **Can I defend this?** — Could I explain and justify every claim to a colleague, reviewer, or student without referencing the AI's reasoning?
2. **Is this mine?** — Does this reflect my actual position, or did I passively accept the AI's framing because it sounded reasonable?
3. **Did I verify?** — Have I independently confirmed factual claims, citations, and data points?
4. **Would I teach this?** — Am I prepared to stand behind this content in a classroom, committee, or public review?
5. **Is the disclosure honest?** — Does my disclosure statement accurately represent the division of intellectual labor?

If any answer is "no," the content is not ready for release.

## Integrity Report

For substantial high-stakes deliverables, generate an Integrity Report using `templates/integrity-report-template.md`. The report documents:

- **Directive Memo alignment** — Did the final content stay true to your stated intent?
- **AI contribution levels** — Breakdown by dimension (structural organization, language drafting, research synthesis, original ideas, domain judgment, directive memo)
- **Verification checklist** — Citations verified, no hallucinated references, tone consistent, disclosure accurate
- **Flagged items** — Any concerns requiring attention

The Integrity Report is a companion to the disclosure statement, not a replacement. The disclosure appears in the document; the Integrity Report is an internal accountability artifact.

---

## Behavior Notes

- If the document type is ambiguous, ask before selecting a template.
- If a disclosure is requested to be omitted, comply but note: "Disclosure omitted at author's request."
- If producing multiple documents in a session, apply the appropriate template to each independently.
- The disclosure should be concise and unobtrusive — it supports transparency, not defensiveness.
