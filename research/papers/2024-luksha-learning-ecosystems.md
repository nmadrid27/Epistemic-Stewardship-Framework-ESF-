## Key Findings

- Educational institutions need methodologies capable of evolving with technological and social change; static frameworks become obsolete without built-in revision mechanisms.
- Argues for adaptive learning systems that build in structural mechanisms for self-revision, not just best-practice snapshots.
- Learning ecosystems must be designed for emergence and transformation, not optimization for current conditions.

## ESF Relevance

Luksha et al.'s emphasis on adaptive systems with built-in revision mechanisms supports ESF's Framework Evolution Protocol — the structural feature that distinguishes ESF from frameworks that are published as current best practice without provisions for their own update. A framework for AI-assisted work must include mechanisms for self-revision because the AI landscape is itself changing continuously.
