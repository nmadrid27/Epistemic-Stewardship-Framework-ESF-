## Key Findings

- AI challenges the foundational assumption of assessment: that submitted work reflects the submitter's cognitive engagement and understanding.
- Assessment mechanisms must make cognitive processes visible rather than inferring epistemic engagement from product quality alone.
- Discourse analysis reveals that institutional responses to AI cluster into competing framings (threat, tool, transformation) that produce conflicting policy implications.

## ESF Relevance

Bearman et al.'s call for assessment that makes cognitive processes visible aligns directly with ESF's emphasis on process documentation (Directive Memo, gate records, Integrity Reports) as evidence of epistemic engagement. ESF extends this beyond assessment into the production process itself — making the process visible not just for evaluators but for the producer.
