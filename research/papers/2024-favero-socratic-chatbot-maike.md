## Key Findings

- The Maike chatbot demonstrates a Socratic approach in practice: it guides students through critical reflection rather than providing direct answers.
- Socratic interaction produces deeper student engagement than direct instruction, as evidenced by improved critical thinking outcomes.
- The chatbot works by prompting students to articulate what they understand and where they stand, rather than by blocking or gatekeeping access.

## ESF Relevance

Favero et al.'s finding that Socratic interaction produces deeper engagement has methodological implications for ESF: the human gates work not by blocking students but by prompting them to articulate their understanding and position. The Maike findings support ESF's design choice to frame human validation gates as questions that draw out the student's thinking, not checkboxes that verify compliance.
