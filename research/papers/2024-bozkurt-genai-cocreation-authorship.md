## Key Findings

- Generative AI poses specific challenges to traditional notions of authorship, ownership, and academic integrity that existing frameworks are not designed to address.
- "Cocreation" with AI requires new frameworks for understanding intellectual contribution and the division of intellectual labor.
- The single human author model must be replaced with structured transparency about what was contributed by whom in AI-assisted work.

## ESF Relevance

Bozkurt's argument that cocreation with AI requires new frameworks for intellectual contribution supports ESF's positioning. ESF's Directive Memo and Integrity Report operationalize the structured transparency Bozkurt calls for — creating verifiable records of where intellectual direction originated and how it was maintained through AI-assisted production.
