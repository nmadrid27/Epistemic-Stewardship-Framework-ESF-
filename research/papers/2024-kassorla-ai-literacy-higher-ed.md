## Key Findings

- Provides frameworks for integrating AI literacy competencies across higher education curricula at the institutional level.
- Surfaces a persistent gap: while literacy frameworks define what students should understand about AI, they rarely specify the methodology by which understanding is practiced during actual AI-assisted work.
- Identifies institutional barriers to AI literacy integration including faculty preparation, policy coherence, and infrastructure readiness.

## ESF Relevance

Kassorla et al. identify the methodological gap that ESF directly addresses: AI literacy frameworks tell students what to understand but not how to practice that understanding during real work. ESF's four student engagement levels (Discovery, Guided Use, Independent Use, Critical Partnership) provide a developmental progression from exploring AI capabilities to exercising full epistemic stewardship — the operational layer literacy frameworks lack.
