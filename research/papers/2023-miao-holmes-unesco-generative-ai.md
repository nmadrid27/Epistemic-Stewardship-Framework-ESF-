## Key Findings

- Establishes transparency as a policy requirement for AI use in educational contexts: AI involvement should be clearly documented and disclosed.
- Addresses governance and boundaries of AI use in education without structuring the practice of AI-assisted work itself.
- Advocates for institutional policies that balance enabling AI's benefits with protecting academic integrity and student development.

## ESF Relevance

UNESCO's guidance establishes transparency as a policy principle; ESF translates that principle from aspirational policy to operational workflow. Where UNESCO addresses the boundaries of AI use, ESF structures the practice of it — treating transparency not as a value to endorse but as a structural feature of how work is produced, anchored to the Directive Memo and Integrity Report.
