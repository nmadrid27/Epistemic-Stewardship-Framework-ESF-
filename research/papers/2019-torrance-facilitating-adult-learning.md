## Key Findings

*[FLAGGED FOR REVIEW — original key findings were written for the wrong source (E.P. Torrance's adult learning theory). The following are provisional, based on the correct book's known subject matter, and should be verified against the actual text before publication.]*

- Applies agile project management principles (iterative cycles, sprint reviews, retrospectives) to instructional design workflows.
- Argues that iterative development with structured review checkpoints produces better learning outcomes than linear waterfall design processes.
- Identifies the retrospective as the mechanism that prevents process stagnation — teams that skip reflection between cycles lose the adaptive capacity that makes agile effective.

## ESF Relevance

Torrance's agile framework for instructional design supports ESF's phased workflow model and Human Validation Gates — both apply structured iteration with deliberate checkpoints rather than linear production. ESF draws on agile's insight that explicit pause-and-evaluate moments are what distinguish adaptive practice from output-focused production. Note: the Key Findings above are provisional pending verification against the actual text.
