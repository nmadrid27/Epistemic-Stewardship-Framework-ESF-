## Key Findings

- Educational objectives can be organized into a hierarchical taxonomy of cognitive complexity: recall, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
- Tasks at higher taxonomic levels (evaluation, synthesis, creation) inherently require more human judgment than tasks at lower levels.
- The taxonomy describes the cognitive demands of tasks as properties of the tasks themselves, not as discretionary classifications.

## ESF Relevance

Bloom's taxonomy provides the cognitive architecture supporting ESF's Content Epistemic Weight model. The synthesis of Bloom with Perkins et al.'s AIAS yields ESF's three-tier weight classification — high, medium, and low — grounded in what cognitive demands a task actually requires, not merely what a policy might permit.
