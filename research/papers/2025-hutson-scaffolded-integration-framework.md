## Key Findings

- Develops a Three-Tiered Scaffolded Framework requiring students to demonstrate independent proficiency before gaining AI access, using timed tasks and oral defenses to verify genuine competence.
- Access gates must test for understanding, not merely grant permission: the framework distinguishes between a student who has earned AI access and one who has been given it.
- Scaffolded structure progresses from no-AI foundational work through guided AI use to independent AI-integrated work.

## ESF Relevance

Hutson's framework provides one of three independent lines of research that converge on ESF's human-first sequencing principle. His oral defense mechanism — requiring students to demonstrate they can perform without AI before being permitted to use it — informs ESF's Level 2 Phase 1-2 (human-only) architecture, where AI is excluded from the inquiry and positioning phases to ensure independence is genuine.
