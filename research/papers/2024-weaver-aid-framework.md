## Key Findings

- Provides templates, norms, and practical guidance for documenting AI involvement in academic work, normalizing disclosure as a professional practice rather than an admission of weakness.
- Offers a structured approach to transparency that moves beyond voluntary acknowledgment toward systematic documentation.
- Treats disclosure as an end in itself — the requirement is satisfied when the user documents AI involvement.

## ESF Relevance

ESF builds on AID in two directions: first, connecting disclosure to a pre-drafting intellectual authority mechanism (the Directive Memo), making disclosure statements more meaningful because they can be verified against a documented prior position; second, introducing the Integrity Report as a companion that tells the author whether their own epistemic engagement was preserved — where AID tells the reader about the collaboration, the Integrity Report tells the author about themselves. ESF distinguishes compliance transparency from epistemic transparency.
