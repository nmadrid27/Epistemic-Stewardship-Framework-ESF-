## Key Findings

- Systematic review of 146 studies identified four AI application areas in higher education: profiling and prediction, assessment and evaluation, adaptive systems, and intelligent tutoring.
- The overwhelming majority of research targeted student-facing applications; faculty as users of AI in their own professional work were largely absent from the conversation.
- The chronological arc of AI-in-education research reveals characteristic gaps and asymmetries that frameworks must be designed to address and evolve beyond.

## ESF Relevance

Zawacki-Richter et al.'s identification of the faculty-facing gap — the near-complete absence of research on faculty use of AI in their own professional work — remains one of the strongest pieces of evidence supporting ESF's positioning. It also establishes that frameworks should be designed for evolution rather than permanence, supporting ESF's Framework Evolution Protocol.
