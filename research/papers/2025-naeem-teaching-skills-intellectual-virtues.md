## Key Findings

- Develops the Q-Tutor model: AI should teach questioning as an intellectual virtue, not merely as a technique.
- The distinction matters because intellectual virtues are transferable: students who learn to question well develop an epistemic capacity applicable to all AI interactions, not just prescribed ones.
- Addresses generative AI as a context for cultivating epistemic virtues — including intellectual humility, curiosity, and rigor — rather than just managing risks.

## ESF Relevance

Naeem's virtue-based orientation informs ESF's framing of human validation gates as Socratic questions rather than compliance checkboxes. ESF's Five Questions are designed to develop questioning as a habit — a transferable epistemic capacity — not to enforce a checklist. The Q-Tutor model supports treating the gates as sites of genuine intellectual engagement rather than administrative requirements.
