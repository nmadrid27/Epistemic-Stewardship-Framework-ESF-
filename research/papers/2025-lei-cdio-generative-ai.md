## Key Findings

- Validates a teaching approach using the CDIO (Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate) model integrated with generative AI for developing computational thinking.
- Students who function as "systems architects" managing multi-step AI workflows show significant gains in computational thinking compared to passive AI users.
- The architect role — designing and directing the process rather than following prescribed steps — produces deeper competency development.

## ESF Relevance

Lei et al.'s finding that students who design their own epistemic processes (rather than following prescribed ones) show greater competency gains supports ESF's progressive engagement levels. Advanced students in ESF move from guided application of the framework toward designing their own process — the architect orientation that Lei et al. validate empirically.
