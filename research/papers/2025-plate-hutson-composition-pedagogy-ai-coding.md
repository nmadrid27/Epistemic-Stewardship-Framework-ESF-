## Key Findings

- Reconceives composition pedagogy as requiring "rhetorical event" logs and auditable interaction histories with AI.
- The process of engaging with AI (what was queried, what was accepted, what was rejected) is itself a form of rhetorical practice that can be taught and evaluated.
- Interaction audits make students' epistemic decision-making visible and assessable, shifting focus from the product to the decisions that produced it.

## ESF Relevance

Plate and Hutson's argument that AI interaction histories constitute teachable rhetorical practice directly supports ESF's process artifacts: Position Statements, AI interaction logs, and records of resistance operationalize this insight at the workflow level. Their work provides pedagogical justification for treating the production process itself as an epistemic object subject to documentation and evaluation.
