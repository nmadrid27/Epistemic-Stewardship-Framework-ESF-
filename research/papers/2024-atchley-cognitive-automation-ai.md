verification-note: "Confirmed 2026-02-23 (Nathan read) and PDF-confirmed 2026-02-24. Author: Paul Atchley (corresponding, patchley@usf.edu), University of South Florida. Full author list: Atchley, P., Pannell, H., Wofford, K., Hopkins, M., & Atchley, R. A. Article 9:20 (not Article 42). PREVIOUS CITATION ERROR: paper summary had wrong title ('Cognitive Automation in AI-Assisted Work'), wrong authors (Atchley R.A., Kalinowski, Bain), and wrong article number (42). Correct title and authors confirmed from PDF at DOI 10.1186/s41235-024-00547-9. Nathan confirmed core argument (AI as external representation tool reducing information processing demands) from reading the actual paper during Phase 3 gate review. Key Findings below reflect Nathan's confirmed reading of this paper."

## Key Findings

- Argues that AI functions as an external representation tool that reduces information processing demands, with both costs and benefits. Key cost: reduced cognitive engagement with the underlying content.
- Direct quotation: "Pedagogical recommendations should consider the cognitive effects of using external representations and tools like AI to reduce information processing demands."
- Introduces or invokes "cognitive automation" as a concept for the risk that AI efficiency gains diminish cognitive engagement with the work's substance.

## ESF Relevance

Atchley et al.'s cognitive automation concept motivates ESF's Gate Verification Record: by requiring documented evidence of what was reviewed, changed, and challenged at each gate, the record creates an external check against the reduced engagement that AI-assisted workflows can produce. A pattern of gate records with no changes and no challenges across multiple projects signals that cognitive automation may be occurring and flags it for review.
