## Key Findings

- Cognitive processes need not be confined to the brain; they can extend into external tools, notebooks, and other artifacts when specific conditions are met.
- The "active endorsement" condition specifies that for an external resource to count as part of the cognitive system, the human must actively endorse its contributions, have reliable access to it, and have previously endorsed the information it provides.
- Passive acceptance of external output does not constitute genuine cognitive extension — endorsement must be active and deliberate.

## ESF Relevance

The active endorsement condition is the philosophical anchor of the ESF Directive Memo: when a faculty member establishes their intellectual position in writing before engaging AI, they create the standard against which genuine active endorsement can be assessed. Without such a pre-established standard, "endorsement" reduces to the passive stance Clark and Chalmers's framework explicitly does not support.
