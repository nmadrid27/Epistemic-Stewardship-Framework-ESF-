## Key Findings

- AI-assisted knowledge construction creates a fundamental tension: AI can accelerate knowledge production while simultaneously undermining the epistemic development that knowledge production is supposed to foster.
- Proposes a "symbiotic learning partnership" model that requires structural mechanisms to preserve human epistemic agency during AI-assisted work.
- The distinction between cognitive partnership (human engaged, directing, evaluating) and cognitive offloading (human delegating thinking to AI) is identified as central but remains under-operationalized in the literature.

## ESF Relevance

Wu et al. bring Clark and Chalmers's philosophical foundations into direct contact with generative AI in education, arguing that structural mechanisms — not good intentions — are required to preserve epistemic agency. ESF's constructs (Directive Memo, Five Questions, Human Validation Gates) are precisely the operational mechanisms Wu et al. argue must exist but do not provide themselves.
