## Key Findings

- Frames the foundational question of AI in education: is AI being deployed as a tool for empowerment (supporting human agency) or as a substitute for human effort (undermining development)?
- Argues that AI's value in education depends on whether it extends and develops the learner's own capacities, not merely whether it improves performance metrics.
- Provides an early framework for understanding AI as a partner in intellectual development rather than a delivery mechanism.

## ESF Relevance

The empowerment-versus-substitution distinction runs through ESF's entire architecture. The Directive Memo ensures AI functions as an extension of the human's thinking rather than a replacement for it; the Five Questions test whether empowerment or substitution is occurring at each gate. ESF's engagement levels scaffold students from assisted exploration toward independent stewardship, operationalizing Luckin et al.'s empowerment orientation.
