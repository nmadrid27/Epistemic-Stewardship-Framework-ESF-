## Key Findings

- Defines five levels of AI involvement in student assessment: no AI, AI-assisted ideation, AI-assisted content generation, AI-led generation with human editing, and full AI generation.
- Advances the field beyond binary permitted/prohibited framing by acknowledging that appropriate AI involvement varies by task and context.
- Frames AI involvement levels as instructor policy choices — the instructor decides which level is appropriate for a given assignment.

## ESF Relevance

ESF builds on AIAS while reframing the calibration question: where AIAS asks "how much AI should we allow?" (a policy question), ESF asks "how much human intellectual authority does this content demand?" (an epistemic question). The synthesis of AIAS with Bloom's taxonomy yields ESF's Content Epistemic Weight model, which treats required human involvement as a property of the content type itself rather than a discretionary policy decision.
