## Key Findings

- AI in higher education is framed through two dominant Discourses: (1) the Discourse of imperative change (AI as inevitable, all must adapt) and (2) the Discourse of altering authority (AI as redistributor of agency across staff, machines, corporations, and students).
- Both Discourses attend to AI's structural role in higher education while leaving accountability for how AI mediates cognitive engagement and learning relationships largely unaddressed.
- The field needs research that traces accountability in AI-mediated practices and explores how AI influences learning and teaching relationships at the process level.

## ESF Relevance

Bearman et al.'s discourse analysis identifies an accountability gap at the institutional level: dominant frameworks respond to AI's presence (threat or tool) without building structures to trace how AI shapes what students actually think and produce. This gap at the discourse level motivates ESF's structural approach — making accountability a built-in workflow mechanism rather than a policy addendum.

Used in ESF for: problem framing (institutional responses leave accountability unaddressed), and the B.2 cluster alongside Fischer et al. (2024) on cognitive process visibility.

## Note on Earlier Citation Error

This paper was previously cited incorrectly in ESF drafts as: "Bearman et al. (2024). Discourses of artificial intelligence in higher education assessment. Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 49(2), 171–183." That citation was fabricated. The correct citation is above. The process visibility argument formerly attributed to this paper has been reassigned to Fischer et al. (2024), AEIH 49(2), 233–245.
