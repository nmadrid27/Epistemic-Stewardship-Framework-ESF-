## Key Findings

- Establishes five value-based AI principles: inclusive growth, human-centered values, transparency, robustness and security, and accountability.
- Transparency and explainability are codified as foundational requirements for responsible AI deployment across sectors.
- The principles address governance at the system and institutional level rather than specifying operational methodology for individual users.

## ESF Relevance

The OECD principles establish transparency and accountability as policy requirements applicable in educational contexts. ESF operationalizes these principles at the workflow level — translating "AI should be transparent" into structured mechanisms (Directive Memo, gate records, Integrity Reports) that make transparency verifiable rather than merely aspirational.
