## Key Findings

- Formalizes the H-AI-H (Human-AI-Human) cycle as a structural principle: every AI interaction must be bookended by human inquiry before and human reflection after.
- The cycle ensures AI functions as a resource within a human-directed process rather than as the process itself.
- Provides a policy-level scaffolding scale for K-12 that formalizes progressive AI access tied to demonstrated competency.

## ESF Relevance

The H-AI-H cycle is directly implemented in ESF's Level 2 student workflow (Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect): Phases 1 and 2 are human-only, Phase 3 introduces AI, and Phase 5 returns to human-only reflection. The Washington OSPI policy provides institutional validation of the human-first sequencing principle that ESF adopts as structural at the higher education level.
