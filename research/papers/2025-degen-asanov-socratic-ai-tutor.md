## Key Findings

- Controlled experiment at the University of Kassel with 65 pre-service teacher students. Compared a Socratic AI Tutor (questions students' reasoning) against an uninstructed AI chatbot (answers directly). Included baseline assessments and two transfer tasks.
- Core finding: "The structured AI system activated learners' capacity to question, reflect, and take ownership of their reasoning — supporting what they call 'epistemic agency.'" Students in the Socratic Tutor condition showed significantly greater support for critical, independent, and reflective thinking.
- The experimental design provides direct evidence that how AI interacts with students — questioning versus answering — produces measurably different epistemic outcomes.

## ESF Relevance

Degen and Asanov provide the most direct experimental evidence supporting ESF's design choice to frame human gates as questions rather than permissions. Their controlled comparison demonstrates that the Socratic framing produces better epistemic outcomes, not merely better compliance.
