## Key Findings

- Practitioner book articulating the 3C Protocol: Compare, Challenge, Curate — a structured approach for practitioners engaging critically with AI-generated content.
- Argues that each interaction with AI output should involve explicit comparison to prior knowledge, active challenge of AI claims, and deliberate curation of what is retained.
- Written from a practitioner perspective rather than a research perspective; presents practitioner-tested methodology rather than empirical findings.

## ESF Relevance

The 3C Protocol is the source for ESF's practitioner-facing verification heuristic. Note: This is a practitioner book (ISBN 9798293364923), not a peer-reviewed publication — epistemic weight is practitioner, not established research. Citations and claims from this source should be marked accordingly and not represented as peer-reviewed findings.
