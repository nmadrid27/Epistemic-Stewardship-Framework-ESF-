## Key Findings

- Learning is optimized when extraneous cognitive load is minimized, freeing resources for germane processing — the mental effort that produces genuine understanding.
- Cognitive load operates across three channels: intrinsic (task complexity), extraneous (poor presentation), and germane (schema construction).
- In educational contexts, reducing the wrong type of cognitive load (germane, schema-building effort) can undermine learning even while improving performance.

## ESF Relevance

Sweller's theory reveals the central paradox ESF addresses: AI tools reduce cognitive load across the board, but the effort they eliminate in educational contexts may be precisely the effort that produces learning. ESF responds by redistributing rather than simply reducing cognitive load — the Directive Memo and Five Questions reintroduce targeted cognitive effort at the points (intellectual direction, evaluative judgment, epistemic accountability) where it matters most.
