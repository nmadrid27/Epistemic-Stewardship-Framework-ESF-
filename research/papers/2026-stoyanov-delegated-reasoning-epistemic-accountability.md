## Key Findings

- Develops the concept of "epistemic audit" and traceability: when reasoning is delegated to AI, structural accountability mechanisms are required to maintain the delegating agent's epistemic responsibility.
- Argues that delegation without accountability is not a legitimate cognitive partnership — it is a transfer of epistemic responsibility that the human may not notice and cannot later defend.
- Addresses the concept at a philosophical level, without providing operational templates for implementing epistemic audit in practice.

## ESF Relevance

Stoyanov's epistemic audit concept directly parallels ESF's Integrity Reports, which serve as the operational implementation of what Stoyanov describes philosophically. ESF provides the templates and workflow integration that Stoyanov's framework calls for but does not supply. Note: [PREPRINT] — findings not yet peer-reviewed; treat as [INFERRED] pending publication.
