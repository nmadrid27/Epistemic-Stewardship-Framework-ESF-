## Key Findings

- Designs and validates a five-phase Research-Based Learning model integrating an AI Research Assistant (AIRA): problem identification, research plan design, implementation and data collection, AI-supported analysis, and publication/reflection.
- Human-first sequencing is structural: problem identification phase is explicitly human-led before AI enters the process. AI functions as a collaborative tool, not a director of inquiry.
- Expert evaluation yielded very high suitability (M = 4.89, SD = 0.31). Governance framework uses 6M model (Man, Machine, Material, Money, Method, Measurement).

## ESF Relevance

Pasmala et al. provide a third independent line of research converging on ESF's human-first sequencing principle (alongside Hutson 2025 and Washington OSPI 2024). The five-stage RBL-AI model structures human-led problem identification and research planning (Phases 1-2) as foundational before AI-enhanced analysis enters (Phase 4). The paper's explicit design principle — "ethical judgment and scholarly responsibility remain learner- and instructor-centered" — directly parallels ESF's Level 2 architecture. AI is positioned as a cognitive scaffold that augments rather than replaces human reasoning. Paper confirmed peer-reviewed; no "90% cognitive load" figure appears in the text. ESF citations updated to reflect the structural sequencing argument, not a quantitative finding.
