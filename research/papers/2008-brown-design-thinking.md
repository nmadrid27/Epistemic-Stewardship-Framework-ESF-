## Key Findings

- Design thinking is an iterative methodology built on cycles of divergent exploration and convergent decision-making, with human judgment operating at each convergence point.
- The model normalizes iteration: work is expected to be revised through multiple cycles rather than produced in a single pass.
- Human judgment and values are essential at each convergence decision, determining what the work is and what it stands for.

## ESF Relevance

ESF adapts design thinking's iterative structure while adding a dimension it does not address: whether human intellectual ownership is maintained through successive AI-assisted revision cycles, or whether each iteration drifts further from the human's original position. ESF's Human Validation Gates serve as epistemically charged convergence points.
