## Key Findings

- Distributed cognition theory frames cognition as a property of systems comprising people, tools, and artifacts — not solely of individual minds.
- Ethnographic study of naval navigation demonstrates that distributed cognitive systems require active coordination to function coherently; someone must ensure that distributed contributions serve a unified purpose.
- When the coordinating function (determining what the work is about, what it argues, what it values) migrates from the human to a tool or instrument, the human's epistemic agency is compromised even if editorial control is retained.

## ESF Relevance

Hutchins's coordination insight maps directly onto AI-assisted academic work: the human must retain the coordinating role — determining the intellectual direction, argument, and values of the work — even when cognitive labor is distributed to AI. ESF's Directive Memo and Human Validation Gates are structural mechanisms that keep coordination with the human.
