## Key Findings

- Argues that AI literacy is a fundamental competency for all citizens, not just technologists — framed as a civic rather than technical capacity.
- The ED-AI Lit framework encompasses critical evaluation of AI-generated content, understanding of AI systems' limitations, and informed decision-making about AI use.
- What matters is not technical proficiency with AI tools but the capacity to maintain one's intellectual relationship to the work they produce.

## ESF Relevance

Allen and Kendeou's reframing of AI literacy from technical competency to epistemic practice aligns directly with ESF's emphasis on epistemic agency over tool proficiency. However, their framework defines what students should understand about AI without specifying the methodology by which understanding is practiced during actual work — the operational gap that ESF's student engagement levels address.
