# The Epistemic Stewardship Framework

## Student Implementation Guide

---

## A. Why This Matters to You

You are going to use AI. That is not the question.

The question is whether the work you produce with AI is actually yours: whether it reflects your thinking, your judgment, and your developing expertise, or whether it is something you accepted because it sounded good enough to submit.

This is not a question about academic integrity in the traditional sense. You are not being accused of anything. This guide exists because a new problem has emerged that no previous generation of students has faced. AI tools can produce work that is competent, well-organized, and persuasive, and that has nothing to do with what you know, what you believe, or what you are learning to do.

The Epistemic Stewardship Framework (ESF) gives you a process for using AI that keeps the intellectual work yours. Not by restricting what tools you can use, but by structuring *when* and *how* you use them so that your thinking stays at the center.

Here is the core insight: **you must know what you think before the AI tells you what to think.** The student process builds in that sequence. You articulate your understanding, stake out your position, and *then* bring AI into the conversation as a thinking partner. If you skip that sequence, the AI fills the vacuum with plausible content, and you learn to approve rather than to think.

This guide introduces a five-phase process (Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect) and four engagement levels that develop your capacity to work with AI as a genuine intellectual partner. The goal is not less AI use or more AI use. The goal is *better* AI use: the kind where you can defend every claim, explain every choice, and honestly describe what you contributed and what the AI contributed.

That skill, epistemic stewardship, is what your future employers, collaborators, and audiences will expect from you. Not whether you used AI, but whether you used it well.

---

## B. The Student Process: Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect

This is your process for working with AI on any assignment that matters. It is built on two principles:

1. **You think first, AI assists second.** AI does not enter the process until Phase 3. Phases 1 and 2 are yours alone.
2. **Human gates verify understanding.** At each phase transition, you must demonstrate (to yourself and sometimes to your instructor) that you genuinely understand what you are doing. Gates are not permission slips. They are checkpoints that make your thinking visible.

### Phase 1: Inquire

**What you do:** Ask yourself the questions that define the problem. What is the assignment actually asking? What do I already know about this? What assumptions am I making? What do I not understand yet?

**Why this matters:** The Inquire phase forces you to engage with the problem on your own terms before AI offers you its version. If you jump straight to AI, you get the AI's interpretation of the problem, which may be competent but is not yours. Starting with your own questions means the work that follows is grounded in your understanding, not the AI's.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- Read the assignment prompt carefully. Identify what it is really asking: not just the surface instructions, but the intellectual challenge underneath.
- Write down what you already know about the topic. This can be rough (notes, fragments, questions). The point is to activate your own knowledge before encountering the AI's.
- Identify what you do not know. What would you need to research, read, or think through before you could take a position?
- Name your assumptions. What are you taking for granted that might need examination?

**Human Gate:** *Can I explain this problem in my own words?* If you cannot articulate the problem without echoing the assignment prompt, you are not ready to proceed. Stay in Inquire until you can.

---

### Phase 2: Position

**What you do:** State your position, your emphasis, and your non-negotiables, in writing, before AI enters the process.

**Why this matters:** This is where learning happens. The act of committing to a position, even a preliminary one, requires you to synthesize what you discovered in the Inquire phase into a coherent stance. This is the cognitive work that AI cannot do for you, and the cognitive work that education is designed to develop.

The Position phase creates an anchor. When AI produces something different from what you intended in Phase 3, you will notice, because you wrote down what you intended.

**What this looks like in practice:**

Write a **Position Statement** with three elements:

1. **What is my position?** State what you think, what you want to argue, or what you are trying to create. One to three sentences.

   > *Example (History essay):* "I think the Treaty of Versailles failed not because its terms were too harsh, but because the enforcement mechanisms were designed to fail. I want to argue that the political structure of the League of Nations made consistent enforcement impossible."

   > *Example (Design project):* "This poster series should make climate data feel personal, not abstract. I want each poster to connect a global statistic to a daily experience the viewer recognizes."

   > *Example (Engineering report):* "Our bridge design prioritizes material efficiency over redundancy. I want the report to demonstrate that our load calculations justify this choice, not just assert it."

2. **What matters most?** Identify what you want to emphasize and what you want to avoid.

   > *Example:* "Emphasize the structural analysis. De-emphasize the historical context; the professor said we should assume the reader knows the background."

3. **What is non-negotiable?** Name the elements that must be present in the final work regardless of what the AI suggests.

   > *Example:* "Must include at least two primary sources I found myself. Must address the counterargument about economic factors. Must not use sources I cannot access and verify."

The Position Statement should take 5-10 minutes. Those minutes are where the learning happens. If you find you cannot write it (you do not know what your position is, or you have not read enough to have one), that is the most valuable information the exercise can produce. It tells you to go back to Inquire.

**Human Gate:** *Have I written my position before consulting AI?* The position must exist on paper (or screen) before you open any AI tool. This is not a suggestion. It is the mechanism that protects your intellectual ownership of everything that follows.

---

### Phase 3: Explore

**What you do:** Now bring AI into the conversation. Use it as a thinking partner: to generate options, challenge your assumptions, surface perspectives you had not considered, and pressure-test your position.

**Why this matters:** This is where AI is genuinely valuable. Not as a drafting machine, but as an intellectual sparring partner. With your Position Statement as an anchor, you can engage AI output critically, evaluating it against what you already decided matters rather than accepting it as the default.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- Ask AI to generate alternative approaches to the problem. Compare them to your position.
- Ask AI to argue against your position. See if the counterarguments reveal weaknesses you should address.
- Ask AI to identify assumptions in your position that you may not have noticed.
- Use AI to find relevant sources, examples, or data, then verify them independently.
- Track what the AI suggests and what you think about each suggestion. This is the raw material for your process artifacts in Phase 5.

**The Five Questions activate here.** From this point forward, apply them at every significant decision:

1. **Can I defend this?** Could I explain this to my instructor without saying "the AI suggested it"?
2. **Is this mine?** Does this reflect my thinking, or did I accept it because it sounded reasonable?
3. **Did I verify?** Have I checked factual claims, sources, and data independently?
4. **Would I teach this?** Could I explain my reasoning to a classmate?
5. **Is my disclosure honest?** Could I accurately describe what I contributed versus what the AI contributed?

**Human Gate:** *Can I distinguish my ideas from AI's suggestions?* If you have lost track of which ideas are yours and which came from AI, you need to stop and sort them out. Your Position Statement is the reference point. Anything that aligns with it is likely yours; anything that departs from it needs to be consciously adopted or rejected.

---

### Phase 4: Make

**What you do:** Build the work product. This is the production phase: drafting, designing, coding, composing, constructing. AI assists, guided by your Position Statement and filtered through the Five Questions.

**Why this matters:** Production is where epistemic drift is most likely. The AI generates fluent, well-structured output, and the temptation is to accept it because it sounds good. Your Position Statement is the anchor that prevents this drift. Keep it visible while you work.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- Draft with AI assistance, checking each significant section against your Position Statement.
- When AI output departs from your position, decide consciously: do you want to update your position (legitimate, since positions can evolve through production), or redirect the AI?
- Flag moments where you revised, rejected, or substantially reworked AI output. These are your process artifacts.
- Apply the Five Questions at natural breakpoints: after completing a section, after a major revision, after incorporating new material.

**Human Gate:** *Does this still reflect my position, or did I drift?* Compare the work-in-progress to your Position Statement. If the work has evolved, that may be healthy growth. But if the Position Statement now reads like it was written by someone else, if your original intent has been gradually replaced by the AI's framing, that is drift. It needs to be addressed before you proceed.

---

### Phase 5: Reflect

**What you do:** Evaluate the finished work and document the process. What did you keep, revise, and reject from AI? Why? What did you learn?

**Why this matters:** Reflection is where you consolidate learning. Without it, the process produces an artifact but no growth. The Reflect phase asks you to look back at the full trajectory, from your initial inquiry through your position to the final product, and account for what happened along the way.

**What this looks like in practice:**

**Process artifacts**: document the decisions you made:
- What AI output did you keep, and why?
- What did you revise, and what changed?
- What did you reject, and why?
- Where did your position evolve during the process, and what caused the evolution?

**Reflection prompts:**
- What did I learn from this project that I would not have learned without AI?
- What did I learn *despite* using AI? (Your editorial judgment, verification work, and revision decisions are learning activities.)
- What would I do differently next time?
- Where was I most tempted to accept AI output uncritically, and why? (The honest answer to this question is often the most valuable reflection you can produce.)

**Disclosure**: write an honest account of what you contributed and what the AI contributed. Be specific, not vague. Not "I used AI for help" but "I used AI to generate a first draft of the methodology section, which I then restructured around my Position Statement. The analysis and conclusions are my own."

**Human Gate:** *Can I defend every part of this work?* This is the final gate. If someone pointed to any part of your work and asked "why did you do this?", could you answer with your own reasoning? If yes, the work is yours. If not, you know which parts need more of your thinking.

## C. The Four Engagement Levels

The five-phase process is the same at every level. What changes is how much support you get at each gate and how much independence you exercise.

### Level 1: Discovery

**What it looks like:** You are learning to inquire and position before engaging AI. Your instructor scaffolds the gates, providing prompts for the Inquire phase, templates for the Position Statement, and structured checkpoints during Explore and Make.

**What you are learning:**
- What AI is good at (generating options, organizing information, drafting at speed)
- What AI is bad at (original analysis, disciplinary judgment, knowing when it is wrong)
- How to articulate a problem in your own words before seeking AI input
- How to write a basic Position Statement

**Gate scaffolding:** Instructor provides Inquire prompts, Position Statement templates, and review checkpoints. Gates are embedded in the assignment design.

**Common traps:**
- *Skipping Inquire and Position.* The temptation is to jump straight to AI. The instructor's scaffolding prevents this, but the habit needs to internalize.
- *Assuming AI accuracy.* AI output is fluent, not necessarily correct. At this level, you are learning to separate the two.

**Readiness to progress:** You can articulate what AI does well and poorly for your type of work, and you can write a Position Statement without the template.

---

### Level 2: Guided Use

**What it looks like:** You are working through the full five-phase process within parameters your instructor sets. The gates are designed into the assignment. You must submit your Position Statement before receiving AI access, or demonstrate Inquire work before proceeding.

**What you are learning:**
- How to write Position Statements that establish genuine intellectual direction
- How to apply the Five Questions during Explore and Make
- How to document your process (kept/revised/rejected) as evidence of thinking
- How your discipline's standards affect what counts as "your work"

**Gate scaffolding:** Instructor designs gates into the assignment structure. For example: Position Statement due Tuesday, AI-assisted draft due Thursday, Reflection due Friday. The sequence enforces the process.

**Common traps:**
- *Treating the Position Statement as a formality.* If you write it in 30 seconds without thinking, it will not anchor your work. The Position Statement is the thinking.
- *Disclosing without evaluating.* "I used ChatGPT for research" is a statement, not a disclosure. A disclosure describes what the AI did and what you did.

**Readiness to progress:** Your Position Statements consistently establish genuine positions (not generic placeholders), and your Five Questions answers are consistently "yes" across multiple assignments.

---

### Level 3: Independent Use

**What it looks like:** You are running the five-phase process yourself, deciding when to use AI, writing your own Position Statements, applying your own gates, and producing process artifacts without external prompting.

**What you are learning:**
- How to classify the epistemic demands of your own work
- How to detect drift between your Position Statement and AI output
- How to revise AI output so that it genuinely reflects your position
- When AI use serves your learning and when it undermines it

**Gate scaffolding:** Self-assessed gates with peer review. You and a classmate evaluate each other's process artifacts, not just the final product but the evidence of thinking throughout.

**Common traps:**
- *Confidence without vigilance.* The more comfortable you become with AI, the less critically you may evaluate its output. Repeated exposure reduces the cognitive resources you allocate to oversight. The Five Questions exist to counteract this.
- *Over-relying on one AI tool.* Using the same tool the same way creates blind spots. Varying your approach reveals assumptions you did not know you were making.

**Readiness to progress:** You can explain your process to a classmate, justify your decisions at each gate, and produce an honest process record that a peer could evaluate.

---

### Level 4: Critical Partnership

**What it looks like:** You are a full epistemic steward. You can run the five-phase process across complex, high-stakes projects. You can design gates for your own work and for others'. You can defend your work, articulate your methodology, teach your approach, and critically evaluate AI-assisted work (your own and others').

**What you are learning:**
- How to maintain intellectual ownership across multi-stage projects
- How to design human gates for novel contexts
- How to evaluate frameworks and methodologies (including this one) critically
- How to adapt your methodology to new AI tools and capabilities

**Gate scaffolding:** You create and evaluate your own gates. At this level, the question is not "did I pass the gate?" but "did I design the right gate for this work?"

**Common traps:**
- *Treating the framework as complete.* ESF is a methodology, not a finished answer. At this level, you should be identifying where it falls short, where your discipline requires different approaches, and where the framework itself needs to evolve.
- *Assuming expertise transfers across contexts.* Being skilled at AI-assisted writing does not automatically make you skilled at AI-assisted design, data analysis, or creative work. Each context demands its own calibration.

**What makes this level different:** At Level 4, you are not just following a methodology. You are evaluating, adapting, and contributing to it. The shift from "using the framework" to "critiquing the framework" is the marker of genuine epistemic independence.

---

### Engagement Level Summary

| Level | Name | Operating Phases | Gate Scaffolding | Readiness Indicator |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Discovery | Inquire + Position (learning the human-first sequence) | Instructor scaffolds all gates | Can articulate AI strengths/weaknesses, write Position Statement without template |
| 2 | Guided Use | Full process within structured parameters | Instructor designs gates into assignments | Consistent genuine Position Statements, consistent "yes" on Five Questions |
| 3 | Independent Use | Full process, self-directed | Self-assessed gates with peer review | Can explain methodology to a peer, produce evaluable process record |
| 4 | Critical Partnership | Full process + designing gates for others | Creates and evaluates own gates | Can defend work publicly, design gates for novel contexts, mentor others |

---

## D. The Five Questions

The Five Questions activate in Phase 3 (Explore) and remain active through Phase 5 (Reflect). They are the same questions faculty apply, contextualized for your experience.

### 1. Can I defend this?

Could I explain and justify every part of this work if my instructor, a classmate, or a reviewer asked me about it, without saying "the AI suggested it"?

**What this tests:** Whether you genuinely understand the content or are relying on the AI's apparent authority.

**Red flag:** You cannot explain a claim, a structural choice, or a piece of evidence without referencing what the AI produced.

### 2. Is this mine?

Does this reflect my actual thinking (my position, my emphasis, my voice), or did I accept the AI's framing because it sounded reasonable?

**What this tests:** The difference between active ownership and passive acceptance. Compare what you are considering to your Position Statement from Phase 2. If they diverge, is the divergence a conscious choice or unnoticed drift?

**Red flag:** You can identify multiple sections that reflect the AI's approach rather than yours, but you kept them because they sounded good.

### 3. Did I verify?

Have I independently checked factual claims, sources, data points, and references? Not "did the AI say they were accurate," but did I look them up myself?

**What this tests:** Whether you treat AI output as a starting point or as a final answer. AI tools confidently generate citations that do not exist, statistics that are approximate or fabricated, and claims that are partially true.

**Red flag:** You included a source, statistic, or factual claim that you have not personally confirmed.

### 4. Would I teach this?

Could I explain my process and reasoning to a classmate who asked "how did you do this?", and would that explanation demonstrate learning?

**What this tests:** Whether the process of creating this work developed your understanding or merely produced an artifact.

**Red flag:** Your explanation of how you produced the work is mostly "I asked the AI to..." rather than "I decided to... because..."

### 5. Is my disclosure honest?

Does my disclosure statement accurately describe what I contributed and what the AI contributed? Would I be comfortable if my instructor read the full AI conversation alongside my disclosure?

**What this tests:** The integrity of your self-reporting. An honest disclosure is specific. Not "I used AI for help" but "I used AI to generate three alternative approaches in the Explore phase. I chose one and substantially revised it during Make because the AI's version didn't account for the accessibility constraint in my Position Statement."

**Red flag:** Your disclosure understates AI involvement because you are worried about the grade implications.

### Using the Five Questions

Apply them at every significant decision from Phase 3 onward. Over time, this becomes a habit of mind rather than a checklist.

If any answer is "no," you have three options:
1. **Revise the work** until the answer becomes "yes"
2. **Reduce the AI contribution** and do more of the work yourself
3. **Be transparent** in your disclosure about the specific area where you relied on AI more than you would prefer

Option 3 is not a failure. It is an act of intellectual honesty that demonstrates exactly the kind of reflective practice ESF develops.

---

## E. Process Artifacts: Tracking Your Thinking

Process artifacts are the visible evidence of your cognitive engagement. They document not just *what* you produced, but *how you thought* through the production.

### What to Track

For each significant AI interaction during Phases 3-5:

1. **What did I ask the AI to do?** (Be specific. Not "help with the essay" but "generate three counterarguments to my thesis about the Treaty of Versailles.")
2. **What did the AI produce?** (Brief summary)
3. **What did I keep, revise, or reject?** (This is the most important entry. It documents your editorial judgment.)
4. **Why?** (What was your reasoning? Reference your Position Statement.)
5. **Five Questions check:** (Quick yes/no at the point of decision)

### Records of Resistance

The most revealing process artifacts are not what you accepted from AI. They are what you *rejected*. Every time you read AI output and said "no, that is not what I mean" or "that misses the point" or "that is technically correct but wrong for my argument," you exercised editorial judgment. That judgment is the skill. Document it.

Records of resistance are evidence that you were thinking, not just approving.

### What the Artifacts Reveal

Over time, your process artifacts show patterns:
- Do you tend to accept AI output in certain areas and reject it in others?
- Are there recurring situations where your Five Questions answers are "no"?
- Is your editorial judgment getting sharper? Are you catching more issues over time?
- Are your Position Statements becoming more specific as you learn what works?

These patterns are the evidence of learning. They show you developing epistemic stewardship: the capacity to direct, evaluate, and take ownership of collaborative work.

### Reflection Template

At the end of each project, complete a reflection that ties the process together:

- **Position evolution:** How did my Position Statement hold up? Where did it evolve, and why?
- **Key decisions:** What were the 2-3 most important choices I made during Explore and Make?
- **What I learned:** What did this project teach me that I would not have learned without AI? What did I learn despite using AI?
- **What I would change:** If I did this project again, what would I do differently in each phase?
- **Honest assessment:** Where was I most tempted to accept AI output uncritically, and what does that tell me about my developing practice?

---

## F. Cross-Discipline Examples

The five-phase process works across disciplines because it addresses the *relationship* between you and your work, not the specific content. Here is how it applies in different contexts.

### Studio Art

**Scenario:** You are creating a series of digital illustrations for a portfolio review. You want to use AI image generation as part of your process.

**Inquire:** What is this series about? What am I trying to communicate? You identify your theme: isolation in urban environments. You note what you know about compositional strategies for conveying isolation, and what you want to explore.

**Position:** "This series explores isolation in urban environments. I want stark compositions with high contrast and a limited palette. The emotional tone is quiet, not dramatic. Non-negotiable: every final piece must be substantially reworked by hand. AI-generated images are reference, not output."

**Explore:** You generate reference images with AI. You notice the AI defaults to dramatic, cinematic framing, the opposite of the quiet tone in your Position Statement. You note this as a record of resistance: "Rejected cinematic compositions. AI defaults to spectacle, which contradicts my 'quiet, not dramatic' direction."

**Make:** Using selected references as starting points, you create original hand-rendered illustrations. You check each against your position: Does this feel quiet? Is the palette limited? Is the composition stark?

**Reflect:** "AI was useful for rapid compositional sketching but consistently pushed toward dramatic aesthetics I explicitly rejected. My final pieces are substantially different from any AI reference. The AI showed me what I did *not* want, which clarified what I did."

**Disclosure:** "AI-generated imagery was used as compositional reference during the Explore phase. All final illustrations are original hand-rendered work. The conceptual direction, palette choices, and emotional framing are the artist's own."

### Engineering

**Scenario:** You are writing a technical report on a pedestrian bridge design for a civil engineering course.

**Inquire:** What is the report asking me to demonstrate? Not just describe the design, but demonstrate that my load calculations justify the design choices. What do I need to understand before I can argue this?

**Position:** "Our bridge design prioritizes material efficiency over redundancy. The report must demonstrate that our load calculations justify this choice, not just assert it. Non-negotiable: all calculations are my own. AI does not touch the engineering analysis."

**Explore:** You use AI to research similar bridge designs and their reported performance. You ask AI to identify potential weaknesses in your material efficiency argument. One suggestion (that your safety factors are below industry norms for pedestrian bridges) sends you back to verify your calculations.

**Make:** You use AI to help organize the report structure and draft the background literature section. Calculations, analysis, and design justification remain entirely yours.

**Reflect:** "The AI's challenge about safety factors was the most valuable part of the Explore phase. It forced me to verify my calculations against current code requirements, which strengthened the report. I rejected the AI's suggested report structure because it de-emphasized the calculations in favor of background, the opposite of what my Position Statement required."

### English / Literary Analysis

**Scenario:** You are writing a close reading essay on a passage from *Beloved* for a 200-level American literature course.

**Inquire:** What is Morrison doing in this passage? What do I notice about the language, the structure, the imagery? You re-read the passage multiple times, noting your observations before consulting anything else.

**Position:** "My argument is that Sethe's 'rememory' is not just a psychological concept. Morrison uses it to make the past physically present in the novel's spatial geography. I want to focus on how specific rooms in 124 Bluestone Road encode specific memories. Non-negotiable: every textual claim must cite a specific passage with page number."

**Explore:** You ask AI to help organize your observations into an argumentative structure. The AI suggests a thematic framework grouping rooms by emotional valence. You evaluate this against your Position Statement. Your argument is about *spatial geography*, not emotional categories. Record of resistance: "Rejected AI's thematic framework. My argument is spatial, not emotional. Restructured around the physical layout of the house."

**Make:** You draft the essay, using the spatial organization you chose. AI helps with transitions and prose clarity, but the argument, evidence selection, and textual interpretation are yours.

**Reflect:** "The AI's thematic framework was reasonable for a different essay, but not mine. Recognizing that was the key editorial decision, the moment where my Position Statement prevented me from accepting a competent-but-wrong direction."

### Design

**Scenario:** You are developing a brand identity system for a hypothetical client in a graphic design course.

**Inquire:** Who is the audience? What are the constraints? You research the target demographic (elderly users who distrust technology) and accessibility requirements (WCAG AAA contrast ratios for visual impairment).

**Position:** "The brand should feel approachable but not casual: a healthcare startup targeting elderly users who distrust technology. Visual language should reference familiarity and warmth, not innovation and disruption. Non-negotiable: the color palette must meet WCAG AAA contrast ratios."

**Explore:** You generate initial logo concepts and name options with AI. You evaluate each against your Position Statement. Several lean toward tech-startup aesthetics (clean, minimal, cool-toned), exactly the "innovation and disruption" framing you specified against. Record: "Rejected 4 of 6 concepts. All defaulted to tech-startup visual language despite my brief specifying warmth and familiarity."

**Make:** You develop the identity system from the two concepts that aligned with your position, extensively reworking color, typography, and form language.

**Reflect:** "AI defaults to the dominant aesthetic for 'healthcare startup.' My Position Statement was the mechanism that prevented me from accepting a polished-but-wrong direction. The 4 rejected concepts are useful process artifacts. They demonstrate that I made deliberate choices rather than accepting defaults."

## G. A Note on Academic Integrity

ESF does not replace your institution's academic integrity policy. It works alongside it.

Your institution defines what is and is not permitted. Your instructor may set additional parameters for specific assignments. ESF provides you with the methodology to work *within* whatever boundaries apply, and to do so in a way that serves your learning rather than just your compliance.

The distinction matters. You can comply with every policy and still produce work that does not reflect your thinking. You can use AI within every permitted boundary and still learn nothing. ESF addresses the gap between *following the rules* and *doing the intellectual work*, because in the long run, it is the intellectual work that matters to your development.

If you are unsure whether a particular use of AI is permitted for an assignment, ask your instructor before submitting. If you used AI in a way that exceeds what was permitted, disclose it. Honest disclosure of a mistake is always better than concealment. In an ESF-informed course, your instructor will recognize that the capacity for honest self-assessment is itself evidence of developing epistemic stewardship.

---

## H. Getting Started

You do not need to master all four engagement levels or all five phases to begin. Start where you are.

**If you have never thought about how you use AI:**
Try the Inquire and Position phases before your next AI-assisted assignment. Spend 10 minutes writing down what the problem is, what you already know, and what your position is. Then use AI as usual. Notice whether having a position changes how you evaluate the output.

**If you already use AI regularly but without structure:**
Add the Position Statement to your process. Three sentences: what is my position, what matters most, what is non-negotiable. Keep it visible while you work. See if it changes how you react when the AI suggests something you did not expect.

**If you want to develop a systematic practice:**
Run the full five-phase process for one assignment. Track your process artifacts: what you asked, what you kept, what you rejected, and why. Write the reflection at the end. The patterns you notice are the beginning of your methodology.

**If you are already confident in your AI collaboration:**
Apply the five phases with full rigor to your next high-stakes assignment. Pay particular attention to Phase 5 (Reflect). The patterns in your records of resistance reveal the edges of your practice. If you can design gates for a classmate's work, you may be operating at Level 4.

The goal is not perfection. The goal is honest, evolving practice, the kind where you can look at your work and say, with confidence, "this is mine."

> **AI Collaboration Disclosure:** This student guide was developed through human-AI collaboration. The two-level architecture, the student process model (Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect), and the integration of design thinking with Socratic human gates were designed by the author based on the ESF Framework Document and supported by research from multiple scholarly traditions (Hutson, 2025; Washington OSPI, 2024; Pasmala et al., 2026; Degen & Asanov, 2025; Favero et al., 2024; Naeem, 2025; Plate & Hutson, 2025). AI assisted with structural organization, prose drafting, and the construction of discipline-specific examples. All pedagogical judgments, the developmental progression model, the gate design, and claims about effective student practice reflect the author's professional assessment. This document follows the ESF protocol it describes.
