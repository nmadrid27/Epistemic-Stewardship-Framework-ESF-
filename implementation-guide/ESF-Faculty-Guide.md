# The Epistemic Stewardship Framework
## Faculty Implementation Guide

---

## A. Who This Is For

This guide is for faculty who use AI in their professional work and want a structured methodology for doing so without compromising the intellectual integrity their institutions depend on.

You may be developing syllabi with AI assistance. Writing grant proposals. Drafting accreditation reports. Designing assessments. Preparing scholarship for publication. Producing committee materials. In each case, you are using AI to accelerate work that requires your expertise, your judgment, and your professional authority. The question this guide addresses is not whether you should use AI. It is how you maintain genuine intellectual ownership of the work AI helps you produce.

This guide does not assume a particular AI tool. It applies whether you use a general-purpose chatbot, a specialized writing assistant, or a multi-agent system. It does not assume a particular discipline. It does not assume a particular institutional context.
The author developed it from operational practice at an art and design university and generalized it for cross-disciplinary use.

What it does assume is that you take your role as an intellectual authority seriously: the work you produce under your name should reflect your thinking, your judgment, and your professional position. If that assumption holds, the methodology that follows will help you confirm it remains true as AI becomes a more prominent part of your workflow.

### Your Two Roles

ESF operates at two levels. At **Level 1**, you are a *content producer*: someone who uses AI to create work that represents your professional authority. This guide addresses that role. The workflow (Scope, Direct, Build, Validate, Disclose) structures your own AI-assisted work so that the output genuinely reflects your intellectual direction.

At **Level 2**, your students use a different process (Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect) designed not for production quality but for epistemic development. AI does not enter their process until they have articulated their own understanding and position. Human gates at each transition verify that students are building genuine comprehension, not just accepting AI output.

These levels are connected. When you use ESF Level 1 to design a syllabus, an assignment, or an assessment, you are also designing the epistemic environment your students work within at Level 2. Section G of this guide addresses that design responsibility directly.

## B. The ESF Workflow for Faculty

ESF provides a five-phase workflow for AI-assisted academic work. The workflow scales with stakes: not every task requires every phase. A meeting agenda does not need a Directive Memo. A tenure portfolio does.

### Overview

```
SCOPE → DIRECT → BUILD → VALIDATE → DISCLOSE
```

Each phase transition includes a **Human Validation Gate**: a checkpoint where you confirm, using the Five Questions, that you remain the intellectual owner of the work. A gate is not a formality. It is the mechanism that prevents the gradual, often invisible transfer of intellectual authority from you to the AI.

### Phase 1: Scope

**What you do:** Define what you're producing, who it's for, and how much of your intellectual authority it demands.

**The key decision:** Assess the **Content Epistemic Weight** of the task (see Section C). This determines how much of the workflow you need:

- **High weight** → Full five-phase workflow with Directive Memo, Integrity Report, and formal disclosure
- **Medium weight** → Standard workflow with abbreviated Directive Memo and standard disclosure
- **Low weight** → Scope → Build → Disclose (attribution footer)

**Common mistake:** Underclassifying weight. A syllabus feels routine until you realize it encodes your pedagogical philosophy, your assessment strategy, and your course's intellectual arc.
Documents that claim your professional authority are at least medium weight.

**Gate:** Before proceeding, confirm: *Do I understand what this task demands of me? Have I assessed the stakes accurately?*

### Phase 2: Direct

**What you do:** Write a Directive Memo.

This is the critical step. Before any AI-assisted drafting begins,
you write a short document (entirely without AI) that establishes your intellectual direction:

- **Thesis:** What is this work fundamentally arguing, claiming, or presenting?
- **Emphasis:** What matters most? What should the audience take away above all else?
- **De-emphasis:** What context or research have you considered but intentionally set aside?
- **Rationale:** Why this approach? What informs your professional judgment here?
- **Voice and stance:** How should this work read? What register and posture?
- **Non-negotiables:** What must appear exactly as you specify, regardless of what the AI produces?

The memo can be brief. A few sentences per field is often sufficient. Its function is not comprehensiveness but *commitment*: forcing you to articulate your position before the AI offers its version.

**Why this matters:** Once an AI generates a fluent, well-structured draft, your own position becomes harder to distinguish from the AI's framing. You may find yourself editing the AI's argument rather than having the AI produce *your* argument.
The Directive Memo captures your thinking before contamination.

**Common mistake:** Letting the AI help write the memo. The memo is yours. If you find yourself asking the AI to "suggest what I should emphasize," you've already ceded the intellectual direction the memo is designed to protect.

**Gate (the Ownership Test):**
- [ ] I wrote this without AI assistance
- [ ] I can defend every choice to a colleague
- [ ] This reflects my genuine position, not a synthesis of what sources suggested
- [ ] My non-negotiables are based on my expertise, not on what I expect the AI to produce

### Phase 3: Build

**What you do:** Work with AI to produce the deliverable, guided by your Directive Memo.

This is where AI contributes most: drafting, structuring, iterating, formatting. Your role is direction and evaluation, not drafting from scratch. At natural breakpoints, apply the Five Questions:

1. **Can I defend this?** Could I explain every claim without referencing the AI's reasoning?
2. **Is this mine?** Does this reflect my position, or did I accept the AI's framing because it sounded reasonable? In AI-assisted work, "mine" does not require that every sentence originated with you. It means you exercised *design authority*: you directed the conditions under which the work was produced, you shaped its intellectual trajectory, and you can account for why it says what it says (Schonewille, 2025; Verbeek, 2008, via Chen, 2025). The sharper test: did the AI perform the interpretive judgment through which your professional knowledge develops (Lindebaum et al., 2025/26)? If so, you have ceded something more important than authorship.
3. **Did I verify?** Have I confirmed factual claims, citations, and data independently?
4. **Would I teach this?** Am I prepared to stand behind this in a classroom, committee, or review?
5. **Is the disclosure honest?** Does my planned disclosure accurately describe the division of labor?

**Critical practice:** When the AI's output departs from your Directive Memo, flag the departure. Departures must be *conscious choices*, not silent drift.

**Common mistake:** Building the entire document in one pass without checking in against the memo. Build in sections.

### Phase 4: Validate

**What you do:** Review the completed draft as an epistemic audit, not just a quality check.

- **Memo alignment:** Does the final output match your thesis, emphasis, and stance?
- **Claim verification:** Are citations real? Are data points accurate?
- **Voice check:** Does this sound like you, or like a competent AI approximation of you?
- **Drift documentation:** Where did the final product depart from the memo? Was each departure a conscious choice?

For high-weight content, this phase produces an **Integrity Report** using `templates/integrity-report-template.md`.

**Common mistake:** Skipping validation because the draft "looks good." Fluent AI output is exactly the content most likely to contain subtle drift.

**Gate:** Apply the Five Questions. If any answer is "no," return to Build.

### Phase 5: Disclose

**What you do:** Apply the appropriate disclosure statement and confirm release-readiness.

Disclosure is matched to document type:

- **Scholarship:** Full disclosure specifying AI contribution dimensions, verification status, and author responsibility
- **Course materials:** Statement confirming pedagogical decisions reflect instructor judgment
- **Institutional reports:** Methodology note confirming AI-assisted drafting with human-directed findings
- **Administrative materials:** Attribution footer identifying AI tool and review status

Disclosure is not an admission. It is a professional practice, the same transparency you would expect of a colleague. Two forms of disclosure exist:
- *compliance disclosure* (perfunctory statements that AI was used, designed to satisfy policy)
- *epistemic disclosure* (substantive accounts of the intellectual division of labor, designed to preserve accountability).
Schade (2023) warns that mandated transparency can produce "organized immaturity" when it becomes ritualistic box-ticking. Kahl (2025) frames honest disclosure as a fiduciary act of candour, not reputation management. The fifth question ("Is the disclosure honest?") is your guard against the first becoming the second.

**Gate (final):** Apply the Five Questions one last time. Confirm the disclosure is honest. Release.

## C. Content Epistemic Weight in Practice

Content Epistemic Weight determines which workflow components are required. The classification is yours to make, and making it is itself an act of professional judgment.

### High Weight; Full Workflow Required

- Exam questions and assessment criteria
- Tenure and promotion materials
- Accreditation reports with evaluative recommendations
- Original scholarship submitted for peer review
- Course proposals with new pedagogical rationale
- External review letters
- Grant proposals with research design

### Medium Weight; Standard Workflow Required

- Syllabi and course descriptions
- Assignment descriptions and project briefs
- Rubrics
- Lecture outlines and presentations
- Reading guides and synthesis prompts
- Committee reports and strategy documents
- Workshop materials

### Low Weight; Abbreviated Workflow Sufficient

- Meeting agendas and minutes
- Schedules, calendars, and course logistics
- Resource lists and bibliographies (after citation verification)
- Administrative emails using established templates
- Formatting and layout tasks

### Classification Guidance

When unsure, classify higher. Some content shifts weight based on context:
- A **syllabus** is typically medium weight. A syllabus for a *new course going to a curriculum committee* is high weight.
- A **rubric** is typically medium weight. A rubric for a *capstone assessment defining program learning outcomes* is high weight.
- An **email** is typically low weight. An email *recommending a colleague for a position* is high weight.

The weight belongs to the content, not the format.

## D. Worked Examples

The following walkthroughs demonstrate the ESF workflow applied to faculty tasks within the Applied AI program. ESF was developed from operational practice in this context; these examples reflect tested application. ESF's constructs apply across disciplines and institutional contexts, but no one has yet validated cross-disciplinary application. Faculty in other programs should treat the framework as a starting point requiring adaptation, not a tested implementation guide for their context.

Each example shows all five phases of the Level 1 workflow.

### Example 1: AI 180; Designing a Project Brief (Medium Weight)

**Context:** A faculty member is developing the project brief for P2 in AI 180 (Unleashing Creativity), a course focused on using AI as a creative partner. P2 asks students to explore how AI changes their creative process: the brief must frame the inquiry without prescribing the outcome.

**Phase 1: Scope.** The faculty member classifies this as **medium weight**: it is a project prompt within an existing course, not a new course proposal. The brief shapes student inquiry but does not define the course's intellectual architecture. Standard workflow with abbreviated Directive Memo.

**Phase 2: Direct.** The Directive Memo:
> **Thesis:** Students should be interrogating their own creative process, not producing AI-generated work and calling it exploration. **Emphasis:** The relationship between the student and their tools: what they chose, what they resisted, what surprised them. **De-emphasis:** Technical output quality; a low-resolution experiment is as valid as a polished piece if the student can articulate what they learned. **Voice:** Open and inviting; this is a discovery project, not a production deliverable. **Non-negotiable:** The brief must leave the medium open. Students choose their tools. The prompt cannot be satisfied by AI-only production.

**Phase 3: Build.** The faculty member uses AI to draft three candidate brief framings and a set of guiding questions. Review against the memo: *Does this leave the medium open? Does it center the student's relationship to the process, not the output?* The AI's first framing implied a comparison task (AI vs. non-AI). Redirected: the question is not "how does AI compare" but "what do you notice about yourself when you use it?" The revision shifts from comparison to self-inquiry.

**Phase 4: Validate.** The brief is reviewed against the Directive Memo. The non-negotiable (open medium) is intact. The emphasis on process relationship over output quality is clear. One deliverable note added after validation: the brief should explicitly name a Records of Resistance requirement, since the ESF integration in this course includes structured resistance documentation. That instruction was absent from the AI draft and added by the faculty member.

**Phase 5: Disclose.** Standard course materials disclosure: "Project brief developed with AI-assisted drafting. All learning objectives, framing decisions, and assessment criteria reflect the instructor's pedagogical judgment."

---

### Example 2: AI 201; Designing the Design Intent Assessment (High Weight)

**Context:** A faculty member is developing the Design Intent assignment for AI 201 (Creative Computing with AI). This is the course's primary structured epistemic gate: students write a Design Intent (Position Statement + emphasis/de-emphasis + non-negotiables) before using AI as a production tool. The assignment instructions define what epistemic ownership means in a technical creative context.

**Phase 1: Scope.** The faculty member classifies this as **high weight**: this assignment directly operationalizes the course's core learning outcome (intentional AI use). How the assignment is framed determines what students understand intellectual ownership to mean. Full workflow.

**Phase 2: Direct.** The Directive Memo:
> **Thesis:** A Design Intent is not a plan. It is the student's articulation of what they are trying to make and why it has to be *theirs*. The assignment must make that distinction legible. **Emphasis:** The non-negotiables field: that is where intellectual ownership lives. Students must name what AI cannot decide. **De-emphasis:** Formal completeness; a partial Design Intent that names a genuine non-negotiable is more valuable than a polished one that says nothing. **Rationale:** Without this assignment, students use AI from the beginning of a project and arrive at outcomes they cannot fully defend. The Design Intent creates the human-first moment the course requires. **Non-negotiable:** The assignment rubric must assess whether the non-negotiables are actually non-negotiable, not whether they are well-written.

**Phase 3: Build.** The faculty member uses AI to draft the assignment prompt, rubric criteria, and three annotated student examples (weak, developing, strong). Review: *Does the rubric assess genuine non-negotiability, or just formatting? Do the annotated examples show the distinction between a plan and an ownership statement?* The AI's "strong" example included a beautifully written Design Intent that contained no real non-negotiables. Flagged and revised: the strong example must demonstrate non-negotiables that would actually constrain AI use.

**Phase 4: Validate.** Final assignment reviewed against the Directive Memo. The rubric now includes an explicit criterion: "Non-negotiables name what the student has reserved from AI decision-making." The annotated examples distinguish plan from ownership statement. The emphasis on partial but genuine over polished but empty is present in the rubric guidance. Integrity Report: "AI drafted initial prompt and rubric structure. All rubric criteria, annotated examples, and framing of what constitutes genuine epistemic ownership reflect the instructor's pedagogical position."

**Phase 5: Disclose.** "Assignment developed with AI-assisted drafting. Rubric design, example selection, and the framing of what constitutes intellectual ownership in AI-assisted creative computing reflect the instructor's professional judgment."

---

### Example 3: Faculty Scholarship; Practitioner Paper on AI Pedagogy (High Weight)

**Context:** A faculty member in the Applied AI program is developing a practitioner paper documenting their methodology for maintaining epistemic integrity while using AI extensively in curriculum development. The paper will be submitted for conference review and attributed to the author.

**Phase 1: Scope.** The faculty member classifies this as **high weight**: the paper is attributed scholarship that advances a theoretical and methodological position. Full workflow.

**Phase 2: Direct.** The Directive Memo:
> **Thesis:** The challenge of AI in higher education is not cheating: it is epistemic agency: the capacity to remain the originator of one's intellectual work while using AI as a cognitive partner. **Emphasis:** The Directive Memo as the core innovation; faculty-facing application; self-application as methodological evidence. **De-emphasis:** Tool-specific guidance; student policing; exhaustive literature review. **Voice:** Direct and substantive: scholarly but accessible to faculty without AI research backgrounds. **Non-negotiables:** All cited sources must be verified. The disclosure statement must be accurate to the actual collaboration. No claims about what the framework does that the author has not personally observed.

**Phase 3: Build.** The faculty member uses AI to draft individual sections from source material (existing operational documents, course artifacts, collaboration logs). Review per section: *Does this reflect my intellectual position or a plausible-sounding synthesis? Are the claims ones I can defend in a Q&A?* Several passages in the literature review accurately summarized sources but made attribution claims that were not supported by those sources. Corrected: every attribution claim verified against the primary source before proceeding.

**Phase 4: Validate.** Full draft reviewed against Directive Memo. The Five Questions applied at this gate. "Did I verify?" flagged three citations requiring direct access before submission: documented in the Integrity Report. "Is this mine?" applied to the framework's novel contributions: each claim traced back to the author's operational practice, not derived from the literature. Integrity Report produced before submission.

**Phase 5: Disclose.** Scholarship-level disclosure: "This paper was developed using AI tools for drafting, synthesis, and structural organization from the author's operational source materials. The framework described, all methodological positions, and all novel contribution claims reflect the author's intellectual work. The author applied the Epistemic Stewardship Framework to the paper's own development; an Integrity Report is available on request."

### Reference: Applied AI Program; Full Curriculum Development

ESF was developed from operational practice in curriculum development at an art and design university. In this context, the author applied the workflow to building AI-integrated creative curricula where students produce portfolio artifacts (interactive installations, generative art, design systems) rather than written analysis. The discipline-specific adaptation included:
- Directive Memos specifying studio culture framing, portfolio-artifact requirements, and creative computing media (student-selected tools and environments)
- Content Epistemic Weight calibrated to creative pedagogy: learning outcomes and conceptual arcs are high-weight; weekly studio schedules are low-weight
- The Five Questions adapted for creative contexts: "Would I teach this?" means "would I stand behind this in a studio critique?"
- A multi-agent coordination model for full course design (one workflow implementation; ESF does not prescribe any specific tooling or agent infrastructure)

This reference case demonstrates ESF's adaptability to disciplines where "intellectual ownership" means creative and pedagogical authority, not just textual authorship. The framework's constructs translate across contexts because they address the *relationship* between the human and the work, not the *content* of the work.

### History: Redesigning a Module

**Context:** A history professor redesigning a three-week module on primary source analysis.

**Phase 1 (Scope):** Medium weight: a module within an existing course, not a new course proposal.

**Phase 2 (Direct):** Abbreviated memo: *"Primary sources are not self-evident. Emphasis: contextualization and perspective-taking. Non-negotiable: at least one source must be non-textual."*

**Phase 3 (Build):** AI drafts the three-week sequence. The Week 2 draft over-emphasized factual background and under-emphasized analytical questions. Faculty redirected; the revision centers the analytical framework.

**Phase 5 (Disclose):** "Module developed using AI tools for structural organization. Pedagogical decisions, source selection, and assessment criteria reflect the instructor's judgment."

---

### Business: Creating a Case Study

**Context:** A management professor developing an original case study for an MBA operations course.

**Phase 1 (Scope):** High weight: an original case study embeds the professor's analytical framework and will be attributed to her.

**Phase 2 (Direct):** Full memo: *"Supply chain resilience is not the same as redundancy. The case must demonstrate adaptive capacity, not backup logistics. Emphasis: decision-making under uncertainty with no obviously correct answer. Non-negotiable: based on a disguised real scenario; the ethical dimension (impact on workers) must be embedded in the strategic decision, not treated as a sidebar."*

**Phase 3 (Build):** First AI draft treats the worker-impact question as a separate section. Faculty redirects: integrate the ethical dimension into the strategic decision. The revision complies.

**Phase 4 (Validate):** Integrity Report generated, including verification of factual claims against the real scenario.

## F. Common Pitfalls

These anti-patterns come from practice. Each represents a way the ESF workflow can fail, not through deliberate violation but through the natural path of least resistance.

### 1. "I'll Write the Memo After"

Writing the Directive Memo after AI-assisted drafting defeats its purpose. The memo captures your position *before* the AI's output exists to influence it. If you write the memo after seeing the AI's draft, you may unconsciously adopt the AI's framing as your own. The memo becomes a rationalization, not a direction. If you find yourself doing this, it's a signal that you skipped Phase 2 and are attempting to retrofit it.

### 2. "The AI Basically Got It Right"

This is the most common and most dangerous pitfall. AI output that is 90% aligned with your position feels like it doesn't need correction. But the 10% that diverges (a subtle shift in emphasis, a framing choice you wouldn't have made, a claim slightly stronger than your evidence supports) accumulates across a document. "Basically right" is how epistemic drift begins. The Five Questions are designed to catch this. *Is this mine?* means "would I have written it this way?" not "do I disagree with it?"

### 3. "This Is Just a Low-Stakes Document"

Misclassifying Content Epistemic Weight is the gateway to skipping the workflow for content that actually requires it. A syllabus is not low-stakes; it encodes your pedagogical philosophy. A rubric is not low-stakes; it defines what competence means in your field. When in doubt, classify higher.

### 4. "I Don't Need a Gate for This Section"

Skipping gates between sections during the Build phase allows drift to compound. A small framing shift in Section 2 becomes the foundation for a larger departure in Section 5. Checking each section against the Directive Memo as you build prevents this accumulation.

### 5. "The Disclosure Is a Formality"

If you write your disclosure statement by copying a template without evaluating whether it accurately describes *this specific* collaboration, the disclosure is performative. The fifth question ("Is the disclosure honest?") requires you to actually assess the division of labor. Did you direct the intellectual content? Did AI contribute more than structural organization? Does the disclosure reflect the reality?

### 6. "My Students Don't Need to Know About My Process"

Faculty who use AI in their own work without transparency create a credibility gap when they require transparency from students. ESF's two-level architecture makes this explicit: Level 1 (your production work) and Level 2 (your students' epistemic development) are structurally connected.

When you model ESF in your own practice by disclosing AI use and showing the Directive Memo process, you provide students with evidence that the epistemic discipline you require of them is a professional practice, not a classroom exercise. If you skip Level 1 discipline while enforcing Level 2 discipline, students will notice the asymmetry.

### 7. "I've Been Doing This Long Enough to Skip Steps"

Experience with AI does not reduce the need for structured oversight. Atchley et al. (2024) argue that AI, as an external representation tool, reduces information processing demands: a benefit with a corresponding cost: diminished cognitive engagement with the work's substance. This is the cognitive automation concern: as AI-assisted work becomes routine,
the depth of critical engagement decreases. The Five Questions and gates counteract this. Structured oversight becomes more important, not less, as AI use becomes routine.

---

## G. Designing for Student Epistemic Development

When you design assignments that involve AI, you operate at both ESF levels simultaneously. Your Level 1 work (designing the assignment) creates the conditions for students' Level 2 work (developing epistemic agency through the assignment).

### The Student Process

```
INQUIRE → POSITION → EXPLORE → MAKE → REFLECT
```

AI does not enter until Phase 3 (Explore). Phases 1 and 2 are human-only. Students must articulate what they already know and where they stand *before* AI output exists to react to.

| Phase | What Students Do | Human Gate |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **Inquire** | Define the problem. Surface what they already know. | *Can I explain this in my own words?* |
| **Position** | Write a Position Statement: stance, emphasis, non-negotiables. No AI. | *Have I written my position before consulting AI?* |
| **Explore** | Engage AI as thinking partner. Generate options, challenge assumptions. | *Can I distinguish my ideas from AI's suggestions?* |
| **Make** | Build the work product with AI assistance. Five Questions active. | *Does this still reflect my position, or did I drift?* |
| **Reflect** | Document what was kept, revised, and rejected, and why. | *Can I defend every part of this?* |

### Designing Assignments That Enforce the Process

**Require a Position Statement before AI access.** This is the simplest and most effective structural choice. Before students open any AI tool, they submit: (1) their initial approach, (2) what matters most to them, and (3) what they will not compromise on.

**Sequence deliverables around phases:**
- Checkpoint 1 (Inquire + Position): Problem statement and Position Statement, no AI
- Checkpoint 2 (Explore): AI interaction log: what was queried, what was returned, student's assessment
- Checkpoint 3 (Make): Draft with annotations marking AI-contributed vs. human-originated content
- Final (Reflect): Completed work with reflection on what was kept, revised, and rejected

**Build gates into rubrics.** Reward the quality of epistemic engagement, not just the quality of the final product.
A student who produces excellent work but cannot explain their process has demonstrated compliance, not epistemic agency.

**Scaffold gate complexity by level.** Not all students need the same gate rigor from the start:
- Introductory courses: Instructor provides the gates. Students practice with guided Socratic prompts.
- Intermediate courses: Students use the full process with documented reflections and peer review.
- Advanced courses: Students design their own gates, determining what epistemic checkpoints their project requires.

### Assignment Design Examples

**Example: Studio Art; Generative Portrait Series**
- *Inquire:* Students research three portrait traditions and identify the visual conventions each uses. Written in their own words.
- *Position:* Each student writes a Position Statement: "My series will challenge [convention] by [approach]. I will not compromise on [element]."
- *Explore:* Students use AI image generation to produce 20+ variations, documenting which outputs surprised them and which confirmed their assumptions.
- *Make:* Students select, combine, and rework AI outputs alongside their own studio work. Five Questions at each major revision.
- *Reflect:* Final portfolio includes the Position Statement, three "records of resistance" (AI suggestions they rejected and why), and the finished series.


**Example: Building Arts; Architectural Design Proposal**
- *Inquire:* Students analyze a site and its context: climate, program, material culture, precedents. Written in their own words, no AI.
- *Position:* "My design will respond to [site condition] by [design move]. I will not compromise on [spatial or material principle]."
- *Explore:* Students use AI to generate massing variations and alternative spatial arrangements, documenting which outputs aligned with their intent and which diverged.
- *Make:* Design proposal developed with AI assistance for diagramming and documentation. All spatial reasoning and design decisions are the student's own.
- *Reflect:* Submission includes the original Position Statement, three records of resistance (AI suggestions rejected and why), and a reflection on where AI extended versus replaced design thinking.

### The Faculty Double Role

When you design an assignment using ESF Level 1, and that assignment scaffolds students through ESF Level 2, you are practicing what you preach. The Directive Memo you write for the assignment's design captures your pedagogical intent. The student process you embed in the assignment ensures students develop the same epistemic discipline you exercised in creating it.

This is not incidental. It is the architecture doing what it was built to do.

## Getting Started

1. **This week:** Write one Directive Memo before your next AI-assisted task. It can be three sentences. See if it changes your relationship to the AI's output.

2. **This month:** Apply the Five Questions after your next AI-assisted draft. Note which question is hardest to answer "yes" to.

3. **This term:** Apply the full workflow to one high-weight deliverable. Use the Integrity Report template.

4. **Ongoing:** Share your experience with a colleague. The framework improves through use, critique, and adaptation.
