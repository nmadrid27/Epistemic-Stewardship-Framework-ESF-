# The Epistemic Stewardship Framework

## Faculty Implementation Guide

---

## A. Who This Is For

This guide is for faculty who use AI in their professional work and want a structured methodology for doing so without compromising the intellectual integrity their institutions depend on.

You may be developing syllabi with AI assistance. Writing grant proposals. Drafting accreditation reports. Designing assessments. Preparing scholarship for publication. Producing committee materials. In each case, you are using AI to accelerate work that requires your expertise, your judgment, and your professional authority. The question this guide addresses is not whether you should use AI. It is how you maintain genuine intellectual ownership of the work AI helps you produce.

This guide does not assume a particular AI tool. It applies whether you use a general-purpose chatbot, a specialized writing assistant, or a multi-agent system. It does not assume a particular discipline. The workflow and examples span STEM, humanities, professional programs, and creative fields. It does not assume a particular institutional context, though it was developed from operational practice at an art and design university.

What it does assume is that you take your role as an intellectual authority seriously: the work you produce under your name should reflect your thinking, your judgment, and your professional position. If that assumption holds, the methodology that follows will help you ensure it remains true as AI becomes a more prominent part of your workflow.

### Your Two Roles

ESF operates at two levels. At **Level 1**, you are a *content producer*, someone who uses AI to create work that represents your professional authority. This guide addresses that role. The workflow (Scope, Direct, Build, Validate, Disclose) structures your own AI-assisted work so that the output genuinely reflects your intellectual direction.

At **Level 2**, your students use a different process (Inquire, Position, Explore, Make, Reflect) designed not for production quality but for epistemic development. AI does not enter their process until they have articulated their own understanding and position. Human gates at each transition verify that students are building genuine comprehension, not just accepting AI output.

These levels are connected. When you use ESF Level 1 to design a syllabus, an assignment, or an assessment, you are also designing the epistemic environment your students work within at Level 2. Section G of this guide addresses that design responsibility directly.

## B. The ESF Workflow for Faculty

ESF provides a five-phase workflow for AI-assisted academic work. The workflow scales with stakes: not every task requires every phase. A meeting agenda does not need a Directive Memo. A tenure portfolio does.

### Overview

```
SCOPE → DIRECT → BUILD → VALIDATE → DISCLOSE
```

Each phase transition includes a **Human Validation Gate**, a checkpoint where you confirm, using the Five Questions, that you remain the intellectual owner of the work. A gate is not a formality. It is the mechanism that prevents the gradual, often invisible transfer of intellectual authority from you to the AI.

### Phase 1: Scope

**What you do:** Define what you're producing, who it's for, and how much of your intellectual authority it demands.

**The key decision:** Assess the **Content Epistemic Weight** of the task (see Section C). This determines how much of the workflow you need:

- **High weight** → Full five-phase workflow with Directive Memo, Integrity Report, and formal disclosure
- **Medium weight** → Standard workflow with abbreviated Directive Memo and standard disclosure
- **Low weight** → Scope → Build → Disclose (attribution footer)

**Common mistake:** Underclassifying weight. A syllabus feels routine until you realize it encodes your pedagogical philosophy, your assessment strategy, and your course's intellectual arc. If the document makes claims on your professional authority, it is at least medium weight.

**Gate:** Before proceeding, confirm: *Do I understand what this task demands of me? Have I assessed the stakes accurately?*

### Phase 2: Direct

**What you do:** Write a Directive Memo.

This is the critical step. Before any AI-assisted drafting begins, you write a short document, entirely without AI, that establishes your intellectual direction:

- **Thesis:** What is this work fundamentally arguing, claiming, or presenting?
- **Emphasis:** What matters most? What should the audience take away above all else?
- **De-emphasis:** What context or research have you considered but intentionally set aside?
- **Rationale:** Why this approach? What informs your professional judgment here?
- **Voice and stance:** How should this work read? What register and posture?
- **Non-negotiables:** What must appear exactly as you specify, regardless of what the AI produces?

The memo can be brief. A few sentences per field is often sufficient. Its function is not comprehensiveness but *commitment*: forcing you to articulate your position before the AI offers its version.

**Why this matters:** Once an AI generates a fluent, well-structured draft, your own position becomes harder to distinguish from the AI's framing. You may find yourself editing the AI's argument rather than having the AI produce *your* argument. The Directive Memo captures your thinking in its uncontaminated form, before the AI's output exists to influence it.

**Common mistake:** Letting the AI help write the memo. The memo is yours. If you find yourself asking the AI to "suggest what I should emphasize," you've already ceded the intellectual direction the memo is designed to protect.

**Gate, the Ownership Test:**
- [ ] I wrote this without AI assistance
- [ ] I can defend every choice to a colleague
- [ ] This reflects my genuine position, not a synthesis of what sources suggested

### Phase 3: Build

**What you do:** Work with AI to produce the deliverable, guided by your Directive Memo.

This is where AI contributes most: drafting, structuring, iterating, formatting. Your role is direction and evaluation, not drafting from scratch. At natural breakpoints (after a section, after a major revision) apply the Five Questions:

1. **Can I defend this?** Could I explain every claim without referencing the AI's reasoning?
2. **Is this mine?** Does this reflect my position, or did I accept the AI's framing because it sounded reasonable?
3. **Did I verify?** Have I confirmed factual claims, citations, and data independently?
4. **Would I teach this?** Am I prepared to stand behind this in a classroom, committee, or review?
5. **Is the disclosure honest?** Does my planned disclosure accurately describe the division of labor?

**Critical practice:** When the AI's output departs from your Directive Memo, flag the departure. The AI may surface valid considerations you hadn't anticipated; that's useful. But departures must be *conscious choices*, not silent drift. You decide whether to update your memo (revising your position) or redirect the AI (maintaining your position). Both are legitimate. Undetected drift is not.

**Common mistake:** Building the entire document in one pass without checking in against the memo. Build in sections. Review each against your stated thesis and emphasis before proceeding.

**Gate:** At each breakpoint, apply the Five Questions. Document what you reviewed, what you changed, and what you challenged.

### Phase 4: Validate

**What you do:** Review the completed draft as an epistemic audit, not just a quality check.

Validation is not copyediting. It is a structured review of whether the finished work preserves your intellectual direction:

- **Memo alignment:** Does the final output match your thesis, emphasis, and stance? Where did it drift?
- **Claim verification:** Are citations real? Are data points accurate? Are factual claims independently confirmed?
- **Voice check:** Does this sound like you, or like a competent AI approximation of you?
- **Drift documentation:** Where did the final product depart from the memo? Was each departure a conscious choice?

For high-weight content, this phase produces an **Integrity Report**: a structured document recording the memo alignment check, AI contribution levels, verification status, and any flagged concerns. The Integrity Report is an internal accountability artifact. It does not need to be published, but it should exist.

**Common mistake:** Skipping validation because the draft "looks good." Fluent, well-structured AI output is *exactly* the content most likely to contain subtle drift: the AI's framing substituted for yours, undetected because it reads well.

**Gate:** Apply the Five Questions one more time. If any answer is "no," return to Build.

### Phase 5: Disclose

**What you do:** Apply the appropriate disclosure statement and confirm release-readiness.

Disclosure is matched to document type and audience:

- **Scholarship:** Full disclosure specifying AI contribution dimensions, verification status, and author responsibility
- **Course materials:** Statement confirming pedagogical decisions reflect instructor judgment, with note about Directive Memo if applicable
- **Institutional reports:** Methodology note confirming AI-assisted drafting with human-directed findings
- **Administrative materials:** Attribution footer identifying AI tool and review status

Disclosure is not an admission. It is a professional practice, the same transparency you would expect of a colleague and the same practice you model for students.

**Gate (final):** Apply the Five Questions one last time. Confirm the disclosure is honest. Release.

## C. Content Epistemic Weight in Practice

Content Epistemic Weight determines which workflow components are required. The classification is yours to make, and making it is itself an act of professional judgment.

### High Weight — Full Workflow Required

Content where the intellectual position, evaluative judgment, or original argument must originate with you. The Directive Memo is essential. The Integrity Report is required.

**Faculty examples:**
- Exam questions and assessment criteria (your standards, your judgment)
- Tenure and promotion materials (your claims about your own contribution)
- Accreditation reports with evaluative recommendations (your professional assessment)
- Original scholarship submitted for peer review (your argument, your evidence)
- Course proposals with pedagogical rationale (your educational philosophy)
- External review letters (your professional evaluation of a colleague)
- Grant proposals with research design (your methodology, your hypotheses)

### Medium Weight — Standard Workflow Required

Content where you must substantively shape the direction and evaluate the result, but AI can contribute to structure and drafting. The Directive Memo may be abbreviated. Standard disclosure applies.

**Faculty examples:**
- Syllabi and course descriptions (your course design, AI-assisted formatting and organization)
- Assignment descriptions and project briefs (your learning goals, AI-assisted articulation)
- Rubrics (your criteria, AI-assisted structuring and language)
- Lecture outlines and presentation slides (your content selection, AI-assisted organization)
- Reading guides and synthesis prompts (your interpretive framing, AI-assisted drafting)
- Internal strategy documents and committee reports (your analysis, AI-assisted compilation)
- Course proposals using established templates (your decisions within existing frameworks)
- Workshop materials (your expertise, AI-assisted formatting)

### Low Weight — Abbreviated Workflow Sufficient

Content where AI can draft with light review. An attribution footer is sufficient.

**Faculty examples:**
- Meeting agendas and minutes
- Schedules, calendars, and course logistics
- Resource lists and bibliographies (after citation verification)
- Administrative emails using established templates
- Formatting and layout tasks
- Data entry and compilation
- Internal notes and working documents

### Classification Guidance

When unsure, classify higher rather than lower. The overhead of a Directive Memo for medium-weight content is minutes. The risk of treating high-weight content as low-weight is an integrity concern.

Some content shifts weight based on context:
- A **syllabus** is typically medium weight. A syllabus for a *new course going to a curriculum committee* is high weight; it encodes your pedagogical argument for why the course should exist.
- A **rubric** is typically medium weight. A rubric for a *capstone assessment that defines program learning outcomes* is high weight; it embodies your professional judgment about what competence means in your field.
- An **email** is typically low weight. An email *recommending a colleague for a position* is high weight; it carries your professional evaluation.

The weight belongs to the content, not the format.

## D. Worked Examples

The following walkthroughs demonstrate the ESF workflow applied to common faculty tasks across three disciplines. Each is a complete example showing all five phases.

### Example 1: Biology — Developing a Lab Assessment

**Context:** Dr. Chen, a biology professor, is creating a new lab practical exam for an upper-division molecular biology course. The exam will assess students' ability to design an experiment, not just execute a protocol.

**Phase 1: Scope.** Dr. Chen classifies this as **high weight**: the assessment criteria define what counts as competence in experimental design for her students. Full workflow.

**Phase 2: Direct.** Her Directive Memo:
> **Thesis:** This assessment tests whether students can design a controlled experiment, not whether they can follow instructions. **Emphasis:** Experimental logic: hypothesis formation, variable identification, control design. De-emphasize technique execution (they've demonstrated that in weekly labs). **Rationale:** The department's accreditation review flagged that our assessments over-test procedural knowledge and under-test experimental reasoning. This addresses that gap. **Voice:** Clear, precise, no ambiguity in what's being asked. **Non-negotiable:** The assessment must include a novel scenario students haven't seen in coursework; no recycled examples.

**Phase 3: Build.** Dr. Chen uses AI to draft three candidate scenarios, each requiring students to design an experiment from a research question. She reviews each against her memo: *Does this test experimental logic, not recall? Is the scenario genuinely novel?* She revises one scenario where the AI defaulted to a textbook-adjacent example.

**Phase 4: Validate.** She reviews the final assessment against her memo. The emphasis on experimental logic is preserved. The non-negotiable (novel scenarios) is intact. She verifies that the grading criteria align with her stated thesis: they assess design reasoning, not protocol execution. She drafts an Integrity Report noting: "AI generated initial scenario drafts; I revised for novelty and aligned grading criteria to experimental reasoning emphasis per Directive Memo."

**Phase 5: Disclose.** She appends: "Assessment developed with AI-assisted scenario drafting. All learning objectives, grading criteria, and evaluative standards reflect the instructor's professional judgment."

### Example 2: History — Writing a Syllabus Module on Primary Source Analysis

**Context:** Prof. Okafor, a history professor, is redesigning a three-week module on primary source analysis for an introductory survey course. He wants students to engage with sources as historians, not just readers.

**Phase 1: Scope.** He classifies this as **medium weight**: it's a module within an existing course, not a new course proposal. Standard workflow with abbreviated Directive Memo.

**Phase 2: Direct.** His Directive Memo:
> **Thesis:** Primary sources are not self-evident. Reading them requires asking who wrote this, for whom, why, and what's missing. **Emphasis:** Contextualization and perspective-taking. De-emphasize memorization of source content. **Voice:** Engaging but intellectually serious; these are first-year students, but the analytical skills are real. **Non-negotiable:** At least one source must be non-textual (image, map, material object).

**Phase 3: Build.** Prof. Okafor uses AI to draft the three-week sequence: Week 1 (what is a primary source?), Week 2 (contextualizing sources), Week 3 (conflicting accounts). He checks each week against his memo. The AI's draft for Week 2 over-emphasized factual background and under-emphasized the analytical questions (who, for whom, why, what's missing). He redirects, and the revision centers the analytical framework.

**Phase 4: Validate.** He reviews the module against his memo. The emphasis on contextualization is clear. The non-negotiable (non-textual source) appears in Week 3. He notes one drift: the AI added a comparative essay assignment he hadn't specified. He evaluates it against his thesis. It serves the analytical goals, so he keeps it but documents the addition.

**Phase 5: Disclose.** Standard course materials disclosure: "Module developed using AI tools for structural organization. Pedagogical decisions, source selection, and assessment criteria reflect the instructor's judgment."

### Example 3: Business — Creating a Case Study

**Context:** Dr. Patel, a management professor, is developing an original case study on supply chain resilience for an MBA operations course. The case will be used in class discussion and as an assessment artifact.

**Phase 1: Scope.** She classifies this as **high weight**: an original case study embeds her analytical framework and will be attributed to her. Full workflow.

**Phase 2: Direct.** Her Directive Memo:
> **Thesis:** Supply chain resilience is not the same as redundancy. The case should demonstrate that resilience requires adaptive capacity, not just backup suppliers. **Emphasis:** Decision-making under uncertainty. The protagonist must face tradeoffs with no obviously correct answer. **De-emphasis:** Technical supply chain modeling; this is a strategy course, not an operations research course. **Rationale:** Existing cases in our curriculum treat resilience as a logistics problem. I want students to see it as a strategic leadership problem. **Voice:** Narrative-driven, realistic, with enough ambiguity that reasonable people disagree about the right course of action. **Non-negotiable:** The case must be based on a disguised real scenario, not a purely hypothetical one. The ethical dimension (impact on workers) must be present, not as a sidebar but as a factor in the strategic decision.

**Phase 3: Build.** Dr. Patel provides the AI with the real-world scenario she wants to disguise, along with her memo. The AI drafts the case narrative and discussion questions. She reviews: *Does the narrative center adaptive capacity or just redundancy? Is the ethical dimension woven in or bolted on?* The first draft treats the worker-impact question as a separate section. She redirects: the ethical dimension must be embedded in the strategic decision, not separated from it. The revision integrates it.

**Phase 4: Validate.** She reviews the final case against her memo. The thesis (resilience ≠ redundancy) is clear. The ethical dimension is integrated. The disguise is adequate. She verifies the factual claims in the case against the real scenario. Integrity Report generated: "AI assisted with narrative drafting and discussion question generation. Case scenario, analytical framework, strategic framing, and ethical integration reflect the author's professional judgment and are based on a real-world situation I personally researched."

**Phase 5: Disclose.** Scholarship-level disclosure, since the case may be published: "This case study was developed with AI-assisted drafting. The analytical framework, strategic argument, scenario selection, and all factual claims are the author's. The author assumes full responsibility for the content."

### Reference: Art & Design — Curriculum Development (SCAD)

ESF was developed from operational practice in curriculum development at the Savannah College of Art and Design. In this context, the workflow was applied to building AI-integrated creative curricula where students produce portfolio artifacts (interactive installations, generative art, design systems) rather than written analysis. The discipline-specific adaptation included:

- Directive Memos specifying studio culture framing, portfolio-artifact requirements, and creative computing media (p5.js, ml5.js)
- Content Epistemic Weight calibrated to creative pedagogy: learning outcomes and conceptual arcs are high-weight; weekly studio schedules are low-weight
- The Five Questions adapted for creative contexts: "Would I teach this?" means "would I stand behind this in a studio critique?"
- A seven-agent role model (analyst, PM, architect, author, scrum master, content creator, QA) for full course designs

This reference case demonstrates ESF's adaptability to disciplines where "intellectual ownership" means creative and pedagogical authority, not just textual authorship. The framework's constructs translate across contexts because they address the *relationship* between the human and the work, not the *content* of the work.

## E. Templates and Quick References

ESF provides three templates for faculty use. Each is designed to be used without modification at any institution.

### Directive Memo Template

**Location:** `templates/directive-memo-template.md`

A structured template with all six fields (thesis, emphasis, de-emphasis, rationale, voice, non-negotiables) and the Ownership Test checklist. Use for any high or medium-weight AI-assisted task. The template includes brief guidance for each field and can be completed in 5-15 minutes.

### Integrity Report Template

**Location:** `templates/integrity-report-template.md`

A structured audit document for high-weight content. It records Directive Memo alignment (5-point checklist), verification status, AI contribution levels by dimension (structural organization, language drafting, research synthesis, original ideas, domain judgment, directive memo), the Five Questions, and flagged items. Use after Phase 4 (Validate) for any deliverable where intellectual ownership matters.

### Course AI Policy Template

**Location:** `templates/course-ai-policy-template.md`

A customizable syllabus section for faculty who want to communicate their course's AI use expectations to students. It is structured around five areas: what AI use is encouraged, what requires disclosure, what is prohibited, how AI use is assessed, and how the instructor models transparent AI use in their own work. Adaptable to any discipline and any AI policy stance (restrictive, permissive, or graduated).

### Quick Reference: The Five Questions

Post this where you work. Apply at every phase transition.

| # | Question | Tests For |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Can I defend this?** | Genuine understanding vs. surface familiarity |
| 2 | **Is this mine?** | Active position vs. passive acceptance |
| 3 | **Did I verify?** | Independent confirmation vs. assumed accuracy |
| 4 | **Would I teach this?** | Deep endorsement vs. shallow approval |
| 5 | **Is the disclosure honest?** | Transparent accountability vs. performative compliance |

### Quick Reference: Content Epistemic Weight

| Weight | Requires | Examples |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **High** | Full workflow + Directive Memo + Integrity Report | Exams, tenure materials, accreditation reports, original scholarship, grant proposals |
| **Medium** | Standard workflow + abbreviated memo + disclosure | Syllabi, assignments, rubrics, lectures, committee reports |
| **Low** | Scope → Build → attribution footer | Schedules, agendas, resource lists, formatting, admin emails |

## F. Common Pitfalls

These anti-patterns have been observed in practice. Each represents a way the ESF workflow can fail, not through deliberate violation but through the natural path of least resistance.

### 1. "I'll Write the Memo After"

Writing the Directive Memo after AI-assisted drafting defeats its purpose. The memo captures your position *before* the AI's output exists to influence it. If you write the memo after seeing the AI's draft, you may unconsciously adopt the AI's framing as your own. The memo becomes a rationalization, not a direction. If you find yourself doing this, it's a signal that you skipped Phase 2 and are attempting to retrofit it.

### 2. "The AI Basically Got It Right"

This is the most common and most dangerous pitfall. AI output that is 90% aligned with your position feels like it doesn't need correction. But the 10% that diverges (a subtle shift in emphasis, a framing choice you wouldn't have made, a claim slightly stronger than your evidence supports) accumulates across a document. "Basically right" is how epistemic drift begins. The Five Questions are designed to catch this. *Is this mine?* means "would I have written it this way?" not "do I disagree with it?"

### 3. "This Is Just a Low-Stakes Document"

Misclassifying Content Epistemic Weight is the gateway to skipping the workflow for content that actually requires it. A syllabus is not low-stakes; it encodes your pedagogical philosophy. A rubric is not low-stakes; it defines what competence means in your field. When in doubt, classify higher.

### 4. "I Don't Need a Gate for This Section"

Skipping gates between sections during the Build phase allows drift to compound. A small framing shift in Section 2 becomes the foundation for a larger departure in Section 5. Checking each section against the Directive Memo as you build prevents this accumulation.

### 5. "The Disclosure Is a Formality"

If you write your disclosure statement by copying a template without evaluating whether it accurately describes *this specific* collaboration, the disclosure is performative. The fifth question ("Is the disclosure honest?") requires you to actually assess the division of labor. Did you direct the intellectual content? Did AI contribute more than structural organization? Does the disclosure reflect the reality?

### 6. "My Students Don't Need to Know About My Process"

Faculty who use AI in their own work without transparency create a credibility gap when they require transparency from students. ESF's two-level architecture makes this explicit: Level 1 (your production work) and Level 2 (your students' epistemic development) are structurally connected.

When you model ESF in your own practice, disclosing your AI use and demonstrating the Directive Memo process, you provide students with evidence that the epistemic discipline you require of them is a professional practice, not a classroom exercise. If you skip Level 1 discipline while enforcing Level 2 discipline, students will notice the asymmetry.

### 7. "I've Been Doing This Long Enough to Skip Steps"

Experience with AI does not reduce the need for structured oversight. Atchley et al. (2024) demonstrate that repeated exposure to AI workflows actually *reduces* the cognitive resources humans allocate to oversight, a phenomenon called cognitive automation. The Five Questions and gates are designed to counteract this. Experienced AI users need the structure *more*, not less, because their confidence outpaces their vigilance.

---

## G. Designing for Student Epistemic Development

When you design assignments, courses, or learning experiences that involve AI, you are operating at both ESF levels simultaneously. Your Level 1 work (designing the assignment) creates the conditions for students' Level 2 work (developing epistemic agency through the assignment). This section addresses that design responsibility.

### The Student Process

Students using ESF follow a five-phase process distinct from the faculty workflow:

```
INQUIRE → POSITION → EXPLORE → MAKE → REFLECT
```

The critical design move: AI does not enter until Phase 3 (Explore). Phases 1 and 2 are human-only. Students must articulate what they already know and where they stand *before* AI output exists to react to. This sequencing is supported by converging research on scaffolded integration (Hutson, 2025), the human-AI-human cycle (Washington State OSPI, 2024), and research-based learning with AI (Pasmala et al., 2026).

Each phase transition includes a human gate, a Socratic question that tests understanding rather than grants permission:

| Phase | What Students Do | Human Gate |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **Inquire** | Define the problem. Surface what they already know and what assumptions they carry. | *Can I explain this in my own words?* |
| **Position** | Write a Position Statement: their stance, what matters most, what is non-negotiable. No AI. | *Have I written my position before consulting AI?* |
| **Explore** | Engage AI as a thinking partner. Generate options, challenge assumptions, pressure-test their position. | *Can I distinguish my ideas from AI's suggestions?* |
| **Make** | Build the work product with AI assistance. Five Questions active. | *Does this still reflect my position, or did I drift?* |
| **Reflect** | Evaluate output. Document what was kept, revised, and rejected, and why. | *Can I defend every part of this?* |

### Designing Assignments That Enforce the Process

The most common failure in AI-integrated assignment design is treating AI access as a binary: either students can use it or they cannot. ESF's student process provides a more useful structure. Here are practical ways to embed it.

**Require a Position Statement before AI access.** This is the simplest and most effective structural choice. Before students open any AI tool, they submit a brief document stating: (1) what they think the answer or approach is, (2) what matters most to them in this work, and (3) what they will not compromise on. This is not busywork. It creates the reference point against which all subsequent AI interaction is evaluated.

**Sequence deliverables around phases.** Rather than a single final submission, structure assignments with phase-aligned checkpoints:
- Checkpoint 1 (Inquire + Position): Problem statement and Position Statement, no AI
- Checkpoint 2 (Explore): AI interaction log showing what was queried, what was returned, and what the student's assessment was
- Checkpoint 3 (Make): Draft with annotations marking AI-contributed and human-originated content
- Final (Reflect): Completed work with reflection documenting what was kept, revised, and rejected

**Build gates into rubrics.** Assessment criteria should reward the quality of epistemic engagement, not just the quality of the final product. A student who produces excellent work but cannot explain their process or defend their choices has not demonstrated epistemic agency. A student who produces competent work with a clear record of deliberate decision-making has.

**Scaffold gate complexity by level.** Not all students need the same gate rigor from the start:
- Introductory courses: Instructor provides the gates. Students practice with guided Socratic prompts.
- Intermediate courses: Students use the full process with documented reflections and peer review.
- Advanced courses: Students design their own gates, determining what epistemic checkpoints their project requires.

### Assignment Design Examples

**Example: Studio Art — Generative Portrait Series**
- *Inquire:* Students research three portrait traditions and identify the visual conventions each uses. Written in their own words.
- *Position:* Each student writes a Position Statement: "My series will challenge [convention] by [approach]. I will not compromise on [element]."
- *Explore:* Students use AI image generation to produce 20+ variations, documenting which outputs surprised them and which confirmed their assumptions.
- *Make:* Students select, combine, and rework AI outputs alongside their own studio work. Five Questions at each major revision.
- *Reflect:* Final portfolio includes the Position Statement, three "records of resistance" (AI suggestions they rejected and why), and the finished series.

**Example: Engineering — Structural Analysis Report**
- *Inquire:* Students define the structural problem and list the analytical approaches they know. No AI.
- *Position:* "I will analyze this structure using [method] because [rationale]. My non-negotiable: all calculations must be independently verifiable."
- *Explore:* Students use AI to generate alternative analytical approaches and compare them against their chosen method.
- *Make:* Report drafted with AI assistance for organization and prose. All calculations verified by hand.
- *Reflect:* Submission includes a methods comparison table, calculation verification log, and reflection on where AI was most and least useful.

### The Faculty Double Role

When you design an assignment using ESF Level 1, and that assignment scaffolds students through ESF Level 2, you are practicing what you preach. The Directive Memo you write for the assignment's design captures your pedagogical intent. The student process you embed in the assignment ensures students develop the same epistemic discipline you exercised in creating it.

This is not a coincidence. It is the architecture working as designed. Level 1 and Level 2 are structurally parallel: both require the human to establish their position before AI contributes, both use gates to prevent drift, and both produce documentation that makes the epistemic process visible. The difference is purpose. Level 1 ensures production quality. Level 2 ensures learning.

## Getting Started

You do not need to adopt the full ESF workflow immediately. A practical starting point:

1. **This week:** Write one Directive Memo before your next AI-assisted task. It can be three sentences. See if it changes your relationship to the AI's output.

2. **This month:** Apply the Five Questions after your next AI-assisted draft. Note which question is hardest to answer "yes" to.

3. **This term:** Apply the full workflow to one high-weight deliverable. Use the Integrity Report template. Assess whether the process changed the quality of your intellectual engagement.

4. **Ongoing:** Share your experience with a colleague. The framework improves through use, critique, and adaptation.
