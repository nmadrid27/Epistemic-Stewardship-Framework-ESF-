# AI Use in This Course

*[Course Name], [Term and Year]*
*[Instructor Name]*

## Our Approach to AI

This course takes a [**graduated / permissive / restrictive**] approach to AI use.
The goal is to help you develop the judgment to use AI tools in ways that preserve the intellectual integrity of your work.

*[Customize this paragraph to reflect your discipline, your course goals, and your professional stance on AI. The following sections provide a structure; adapt the content to your context.]*

---

## What AI Use Is Encouraged

*[Describe the kinds of AI use you support in this course. Be specific about tasks, not tools.]*

Examples to adapt:
- Using AI to brainstorm ideas before committing to an approach
- Using AI to generate rough drafts that you substantially revise
- Using AI to explore alternative perspectives on a problem
- Using AI to check your work for clarity, structure, or completeness
- Using AI for research discovery (finding sources, summarizing background)

---

## What Requires Disclosure

*[Describe the kinds of AI use that are permitted but must be disclosed. This is the middle ground between encouraged and prohibited.]*

When you use AI for any of the following, include a brief disclosure statement with your submission:

-
-
-

**Disclosure format:** At the end of your submission, include a short paragraph describing what AI tool you used, what you used it for, and what you contributed that the AI did not. Honesty matters more than format.

## What Is Not Permitted

*[Describe the kinds of AI use that are prohibited in this course. Be clear about why; connect prohibitions to learning objectives, not just rules.]*

The following are not permitted because they bypass the learning this course is designed to develop:

-
-

## How AI Use Is Assessed

*[Describe how AI use (or misuse) affects assessment. Be explicit about what you're evaluating.]*

Your grade reflects **your** thinking, judgment, and creative or analytical work. AI is a tool. Your ability to direct it, evaluate its output, and maintain ownership of the result is what this course develops.

Specifically:
- Work that demonstrates your voice, your reasoning, and your professional judgment will be assessed on its merits, regardless of whether AI was used in the process
- Work that reads as unreviewed AI output (generic, ungrounded in your course learning, or inconsistent with your demonstrated abilities) will be flagged for discussion
- Honest disclosure protects your grade. Dishonest non-disclosure may lower it

## How I Use AI in This Course

*[Model the behavior you expect. Describe your own AI use in developing course materials.]*

I use AI tools in developing materials for this course. My process follows the Epistemic Stewardship Framework:

- I write a Directive Memo establishing my pedagogical intent before using AI to draft
- I review all AI-assisted output against my professional judgment
- I disclose my AI use in course materials
- I apply the same Five Questions I ask you to apply: Can I defend this? Is this mine? Did I verify? Would I teach this? Is the disclosure honest?

I share this not because you need to follow my exact process, but because I believe transparency about AI use is a professional practice worth modeling.

## The Five Questions

When you use AI in your work for this course, ask yourself:

1. **Can I defend this?** Could I explain and justify every part of my submission if asked, without saying "the AI suggested it"?
2. **Is this mine?** Did I direct this narrative, or did I accept the AI's framing because it sounded good?
3. **Did I verify?** Have I checked factual claims, sources, and data independently?
4. **Would I teach this?** Could I explain my process and reasoning to a classmate?
5. **Is my disclosure honest?** Does my disclosure accurately describe how I used AI and what I contributed?

These questions are a practice: a habit of mind that makes your work genuinely yours, whether you used AI or not.

## Questions?

If you are unsure whether a particular use of AI is appropriate for an assignment, ask before submitting. I would rather have a conversation about process than a conversation about a grade.

*This policy may be updated during the term as our understanding of AI tools evolves. Changes will be communicated in class and reflected in this document.*
