# [Institution Name], AI Integration Policy

**Effective:** [Date]
**Version:** [1.0]
**Review cycle:** Annual (aligned with institutional assessment calendar)
**Framework:** Epistemic Stewardship Framework (ESF)

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes [Institution Name]'s approach to artificial intelligence in academic work. It provides a structured methodology for faculty, students, and institutional leaders to use AI tools in ways that preserve intellectual integrity, develop professional capacity, and maintain the standards on which the institution's credibility depends.

This policy is informed by the Epistemic Stewardship Framework (ESF), a methodology for maintaining intellectual ownership in AI-assisted academic work.

---

## 2. Principles

[Institution Name] holds that:

1. **AI use is a professional skill.** The question is not whether faculty and students will use AI, but whether they will use it in ways that serve intellectual integrity and learning.

2. **Methodology matters more than permission.** Rules about what AI use is allowed are insufficient without structured practices for using AI responsibly. This policy provides both.

3. **Faculty model the practice they expect.** Faculty who use AI in their professional work should do so transparently and methodologically, demonstrating the standards they require of students.

4. **Student development is progressive.** Students develop AI collaboration capacity over time. Expectations increase as capacity grows, from guided exploration to independent practice to critical partnership.

5. **Frameworks evolve.** This policy includes a built-in review mechanism. As AI capabilities, institutional contexts, and scholarship on AI in education change, the policy will be revised through a transparent, documented process.

---

## 3. Faculty Expectations

Faculty who use AI tools in their professional academic work are expected to:

- **Apply the ESF workflow** (or an equivalent structured methodology) for high-stakes and medium-stakes content, including scholarship, assessment design, accreditation materials, syllabi, and course proposals
- **Write a Directive Memo** before AI-assisted drafting for high-stakes work, establishing intellectual direction before AI engagement
- **Produce an Integrity Report** for high-stakes deliverables documenting the division of intellectual labor
- **Include appropriate disclosure** on all AI-assisted professional work
- **Include a Course AI Policy section** in course syllabi describing the AI use expectations for students
- **Model transparent AI use** in course materials and professional practice

*[Customize: add discipline-specific expectations, department-level requirements, or evaluation criteria as appropriate.]*

## 4. Student Expectations

Students are expected to develop AI collaboration capacity through progressive engagement:

### Engagement Levels

| Level | Description | Typical Stage | Expectations |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1, Discovery | Exploring AI capabilities and limits | Introductory courses | Experiment openly; compare AI output to own thinking |
| 2, Guided Use | Using AI within structured parameters | Early-mid coursework | Follow assignment-specific guidelines; disclose AI use |
| 3, Independent Use | Self-directing AI collaboration | Mid-late coursework | Write Position Statements; apply Five Questions; produce AI Use Logs |
| 4, Critical Partnership | Full epistemic stewardship | Capstone / advanced | Defend all work; mentor peers; evaluate methodology critically |

### All Students

- Disclose AI use honestly and specifically on all assignments where AI was used
- Follow course-specific AI policies set by the instructor
- Verify all factual claims, citations, and data independently; do not rely on AI accuracy
- Produce work that reflects genuine intellectual engagement, not just AI-generated output

### Disclosure

Students must include a specific disclosure statement describing how AI was used and what the student contributed. "I used AI" is not adequate disclosure. An adequate disclosure describes what the AI was asked to do, what output was kept or revised, and what the student contributed independently.

---

## 5. Academic Integrity

AI use that follows this policy is not an academic integrity violation. AI use that violates this policy is assessed through the institution's existing academic integrity process.

**Permitted with disclosure:**
- Using AI for brainstorming, drafting, research discovery, or organizational tasks
- Incorporating AI-generated content that has been critically evaluated, revised as needed, and disclosed

**Not permitted:**
- Submitting AI-generated work without disclosure
- Submitting AI-generated work without substantive intellectual engagement (evaluation, revision, or original contribution)
- Using AI to produce work in a manner prohibited by the course-specific AI policy
- Fabricating disclosures (claiming less AI involvement than actually occurred)

**Mitigating factors:**
- Honest voluntary disclosure of AI use that exceeds course guidelines demonstrates the reflective capacity this policy develops. Self-reporting is considered a positive indicator, not an aggravating factor.
- Students at Level 1-2 are developing practices. Instructors should treat disclosure gaps as learning opportunities before treating them as violations.

---

## 6. Institutional Assessment

The institution assesses AI integration effectiveness through:

- **Faculty adoption metrics:** Rate of ESF workflow application, Directive Memo usage, disclosure compliance
- **Student progression metrics:** Distribution and advancement across engagement levels
- **Integrity case trends:** AI-related cases before and after policy adoption
- **Accreditation alignment:** ESF practices mapped to accreditor standards
- **Framework evolution:** Documented revisions, challenges, and version changes

Assessment data is collected through existing institutional processes (course evaluation, program assessment, annual reporting). No separate reporting infrastructure is required.

---

## 7. Policy Evolution

This policy is reviewed annually by [designated steward/committee]. The review includes:

- Analysis of adoption data and assessment metrics
- Scan of new scholarship on AI in education
- Stakeholder feedback from faculty, students, and departments
- Proposed revisions with documented rationale
- Version update with changelog

All revisions are documented in the policy's version history. The institutional community is notified of changes at the beginning of each academic year.

### Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | [Date] | Initial policy adoption |
