## My Directive Memo (Pre-AI)

*Write this section BEFORE using AI. What is your position, emphasis, and non-negotiable? Even a few sentences counts. If the assignment is low-stakes and you did not write a memo, note that and explain why.*

**My position:**

>

**What matters most:**

>

**Non-negotiable:**

>

## What I Did With AI

*Briefly describe how you used AI in this assignment. Be specific. Not "I used it for help," but what you actually asked it to do and what it produced.*

>

---

## What I Kept, Revised, and Rejected

*This is the most important section. It documents your editorial judgment: the evidence that you engaged critically with AI output rather than accepting it.*

**Kept (and why):**

>

**Revised (what changed and why):**

>

**Rejected (and why):**

## The Five Questions

*Answer honestly. "No" is not a failure. It is information about where your practice can develop.*

| # | Question | Answer | Notes |
|---|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Can I defend this?** Could I explain every part of my work without saying "the AI suggested it"? | Yes / No | |
| 2 | **Is this mine?** Does this reflect my thinking, not just the AI's framing? | Yes / No | |
| 3 | **Did I verify?** Have I checked facts, sources, and data independently? | Yes / No | |
| 4 | **Would I teach this?** Could I explain my process and reasoning to a classmate? | Yes / No | |
| 5 | **Is my disclosure honest?** Does it accurately describe the AI's role and mine? | Yes / No | |

*If any answer is "no," what would you need to do to change it?*

## Reflection

**What did I learn from this project that I would not have learned without AI?**

>

**What did I learn despite using AI?** (Your editorial judgment, revision process, and verification are learning.)

>

**What would I do differently next time?**

>

**Where was I most tempted to accept AI output uncritically, and why?**
